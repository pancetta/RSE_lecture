# ## Part 1: Python Project Structure (30 minutes)
#
# ### Why Project Structure Matters
#
# As your research code grows beyond a single script, proper organization becomes critical. What 
# starts as a simple analysis script often evolves into hundreds or thousands of lines of code. 
# Without proper structure, this quickly becomes unmaintainable. Good project structure is like 
# good lab organization—everything has its place, making it easy to find what you need and add 
# new components.
#
# - **Maintainability**: Easy to find and update code even months later
# - **Reusability**: Share code across projects and with collaborators without copying files
# - **Reproducibility**: Others (including future you!) can run and verify your work
# - **Collaboration**: Team members can navigate and contribute without getting lost
# - **Testing**: Easier to write and run tests when code is modular
# - **Distribution**: Package your code for others to install with `pip install`
#
# **Research context**: Many research projects fail to be reproducible not because the science is 
# wrong, but because the code is poorly organized and documented. Proper structure from the start 
# prevents this problem.
#
# ### Anatomy of a Research Python Project
#
# A typical research project structure:
#
# ```

# ### Understanding Modules and Packages
#
# **Module**: A single Python file (`.py`) containing functions, classes, and variables. Think of it 
# as a toolbox—a collection of related tools (functions) that solve similar problems.
#
# **Package**: A directory containing multiple modules and an `__init__.py` file. Think of it as a 
# workshop with multiple toolboxes—a larger organizational unit that groups related modules together.
#
# **Why this matters**: When you start out, a single file might be enough. But as your project grows, 
# splitting code into modules makes each file manageable and lets you import only what you need. 
# Packages let you organize modules into logical groups (e.g., one package for data processing, 
# another for visualization).
#
# #### Example Module Structure

# %%
# Let's simulate creating a simple package structure
# In practice, these would be separate files

# File: src/data_processing.py
def load_data(filename):
    """Load experimental data from a file."""
    # Simplified example
    print(f"Loading data from {filename}")
    return [1.2, 2.3, 3.1, 4.5, 2.8]

def clean_data(data, threshold=0.0):
    """Remove negative values and outliers."""
    return [x for x in data if x > threshold]


# File: src/analysis.py
def calculate_statistics(data):
    """Calculate basic statistics for a dataset."""
    n = len(data)
    mean = sum(data) / n
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n
    std = variance ** 0.5
    
    return {
        'mean': mean,
        'std': std,
        'min': min(data),
        'max': max(data),
        'n': n
    }


# File: src/__init__.py (makes src a package)
# __init__.py can be empty or expose key functions:
# from .data_processing import load_data, clean_data
# from .analysis import calculate_statistics

# %%
# Using the modules
data = load_data("experiment_01.csv")
cleaned_data = clean_data(data, threshold=1.0)
stats = calculate_statistics(cleaned_data)

print("Data Statistics:")
for key, value in stats.items():
    if isinstance(value, float):
        print(f"  {key}: {value:.2f}")
    else:
        print(f"  {key}: {value}")

# %% [markdown]
# ### The __init__.py File
#
# The `__init__.py` file serves several purposes. Historically, it was required to make Python 
# recognize a directory as a package (Python 3.3+ relaxed this requirement, but it's still best 
# practice to include one).
#
# 1. **Marks a directory as a Python package**: Without it, older Python versions won't recognize 
#    the directory as importable
# 2. **Controls what gets imported** when someone does `import package_name`: You decide what's 
#    exposed vs. internal
# 3. **Can contain initialization code** for the package: Run setup code when the package is first 
#    imported
#
# **Common mistake**: People often leave `__init__.py` empty and wonder why their imports don't work 
# as expected. Understanding the patterns below helps you choose the right approach for your project.
#
# #### Different __init__.py Patterns

# %%
# Pattern 1: Empty __init__.py
# (Just marks directory as package, users must import specific modules)
# import src.data_processing
# import src.analysis

# Pattern 2: Expose key functions (most common for research code)
# File: src/__init__.py
# from .data_processing import load_data, clean_data
# from .analysis import calculate_statistics
# 
# Now users can do:
# from src import load_data, calculate_statistics

# Pattern 3: Define __all__ for controlled exports
# File: src/__init__.py
# from .data_processing import load_data, clean_data
# from .analysis import calculate_statistics
# 
# __all__ = ['load_data', 'clean_data', 'calculate_statistics']
# 
# This controls what 'from src import *' brings in

print("__init__.py patterns demonstrated above")

# %% [markdown]
# **Which pattern to use?**
# - **Pattern 1 (empty)**: Simple projects, or when you want users to be explicit about imports
# - **Pattern 2 (expose functions)**: Most research packages—makes the API clean and discoverable
# - **Pattern 3 (with __all__)**: Libraries you're distributing to others—gives fine control over the 
#   public API
#
# **Pro tip**: The dot in `from .module` means "from the current package". This is called a relative 
# import and prevents name collisions if your package name matches a standard library module.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Design Principles for Maintainable Code
#
# Now that we understand how to structure projects and organize modules, let's discuss the **design 
# principles** that make code maintainable, reusable, and easy to understand. Good structure is not 
# just about folders and files—it's about how you design your code within those files.
#
# These principles come from decades of software engineering experience and apply especially well to 
# research software, where code often lives for years and is modified by multiple people (including 
# future you!).
#
# #### Principle 1: DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
#
# **The problem**: Copy-pasting code creates maintenance nightmares. When you find a bug or need to 
# change behavior, you must remember to update all copies. Miss one, and you have inconsistent 
# behavior that's hard to track down.
#
# **The solution**: Write code once, reuse it everywhere. If you find yourself copying and pasting, 
# extract that code into a function or class.
#
# **Bad example - Repetitive code:**

# %%
# DON'T DO THIS: Repeated calculation logic
def analyze_temperature_data(temps):
    """Analyze temperature dataset."""
    mean = sum(temps) / len(temps)
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in temps) / len(temps)
    std_dev = variance ** 0.5
    return {'mean': mean, 'std': std_dev}

def analyze_pressure_data(pressures):
    """Analyze pressure dataset."""
    mean = sum(pressures) / len(pressures)
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in pressures) / len(pressures)
    std_dev = variance ** 0.5
    return {'mean': mean, 'std': std_dev}

def analyze_humidity_data(humidity):
    """Analyze humidity dataset."""
    mean = sum(humidity) / len(humidity)
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in humidity) / len(humidity)
    std_dev = variance ** 0.5
    return {'mean': mean, 'std': std_dev}

# Same calculation logic repeated three times! ❌

# %% [markdown]
# **Good example - DRY principle applied:**

# %%
# DO THIS: Extract common logic
def calculate_statistics(data):
    """Calculate mean and standard deviation for any dataset."""
    if not data:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate statistics for empty dataset")
    
    mean = sum(data) / len(data)
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / len(data)
    std_dev = variance ** 0.5
    return {'mean': mean, 'std': std_dev}

# Now reuse it for any type of data
temp_stats = calculate_statistics([15.2, 16.8, 14.5, 17.3])
pressure_stats = calculate_statistics([1013, 1015, 1012, 1014])
humidity_stats = calculate_statistics([65, 68, 72, 70])

print(f"Temperature: {temp_stats}")
print(f"Pressure: {pressure_stats}")
print(f"Humidity: {humidity_stats}")

# One function, reused three times! ✓
# Bug fixes or improvements only need to be made in ONE place.

# %% [markdown]
# **Why DRY matters in research**:
# - **Fix bugs once**: When you find a calculation error, fix it in one place
# - **Update algorithms easily**: Improve your method without hunting for all copies
# - **Consistency**: The same input always produces the same output
# - **Testing**: Test the logic once instead of testing every copy
#
# **Warning**: Don't take DRY to extremes. If code *looks* similar but has different *purposes*, 
# it's okay to keep it separate. DRY applies to logic and behavior, not just appearance.
#
# #### Principle 2: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
#
# **The idea**: Each function or module should do **one thing** and do it well. If you can't explain 
# what a function does in one simple sentence, it's probably doing too much.
#
# **The benefit**: When each component has one job, it's easier to:
# - Understand what the code does
# - Find where bugs are
# - Test each piece independently
# - Reuse code in different contexts
# - Modify behavior without breaking unrelated functionality
#
# **Bad example - Too many responsibilities:**

# %%
# DON'T DO THIS: Function doing too many things
def process_climate_data_badly(filename):
    """Process climate data... but what does it actually do?"""
    # Responsibility 1: Read file
    with open(filename) as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
    
    # Responsibility 2: Parse data
    temps = []
    for line in lines[1:]:  # Skip header
        parts = line.split(',')
        temps.append(float(parts[2]))
    
    # Responsibility 3: Calculate statistics
    mean_temp = sum(temps) / len(temps)
    
    # Responsibility 4: Format output
    output = f"Average temperature: {mean_temp:.1f}°C"
    
    # Responsibility 5: Write result
    with open('results.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write(output)
    
    # Responsibility 6: Generate plot
    # (imagine plotting code here)
    
    return mean_temp

# This function does EVERYTHING. Hard to test, hard to reuse, hard to modify. ❌

# %% [markdown]
# **Good example - Single Responsibility:**

# %%
# DO THIS: Separate concerns into focused functions

def read_csv_file(filename):
    """Read lines from a CSV file."""
    with open(filename) as f:
        return f.readlines()

def parse_temperature_column(lines, column_index=2):
    """Extract temperature values from CSV lines."""
    temps = []
    for line in lines[1:]:  # Skip header
        parts = line.split(',')
        temps.append(float(parts[column_index]))
    return temps

def calculate_mean(values):
    """Calculate arithmetic mean of values."""
    return sum(values) / len(values)

def format_temperature_result(mean_temp):
    """Format temperature result as a string."""
    return f"Average temperature: {mean_temp:.1f}°C"

def write_text_file(filename, content):
    """Write content to a text file."""
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write(content)

# Now compose them for the full workflow:
# lines = read_csv_file('climate_data.csv')
# temps = parse_temperature_column(lines)
# mean_temp = calculate_mean(temps)
# result_text = format_temperature_result(mean_temp)
# write_text_file('results.txt', result_text)

print("Each function has ONE clear job! ✓")

# %% [markdown]
# **Benefits of this approach**:
# - Each function is easy to test independently
# - Functions are reusable in different contexts (e.g., `calculate_mean` works for any data)
# - Easy to swap implementations (e.g., use pandas instead of manual parsing)
# - Clear what each function does just from its name
# - Bugs are easier to locate (if parsing fails, check `parse_temperature_column`)
#
# #### Principle 3: Separation of Concerns
#
# **The idea**: Different aspects of your program should be in different places. Don't mix data 
# loading with analysis logic, don't mix visualization with calculations, don't mix business logic 
# with file I/O.
#
# **Why it matters**: Research projects often evolve from a single analysis script to a complex 
# pipeline. If concerns are separated from the start, you can easily:
# - Switch data sources (file → database → API)
# - Change output format (console → file → web)
# - Reuse analysis logic in different projects
# - Test each layer independently
#
# **Project structure enforces separation:**
#
# ```
# src/
# ├── data_loading.py      # Concern: Getting data into memory
# ├── preprocessing.py     # Concern: Cleaning and transforming data
# ├── analysis.py          # Concern: Scientific calculations
# ├── visualization.py     # Concern: Creating plots
# └── export.py            # Concern: Saving results
# ```
#
# **Example in practice:**

# %%
# GOOD: Clear separation of concerns

# Concern 1: Data access (could switch from files to database)
def load_experiment_data(source):
    """Load data from source (file, database, API)."""
    # In real code, handle different source types
    return [15.2, 16.8, 14.5, 17.3, 15.9]

# Concern 2: Data validation (ensures quality)
def validate_temperature_data(temps):
    """Check that temperature data is physically reasonable."""
    return [t for t in temps if -100 < t < 100]

# Concern 3: Analysis (pure calculation, no I/O)
def compute_anomaly(temps, baseline):
    """Calculate temperature anomalies from baseline."""
    return [t - baseline for t in temps]

# Concern 4: Presentation (formatting for output)
def format_anomaly_report(anomalies):
    """Create human-readable report of anomalies."""
    return f"Anomalies: {[f'{a:.1f}' for a in anomalies]}"

# Workflow: compose the concerns
data = load_experiment_data('experiment.csv')
valid_data = validate_temperature_data(data)
anomalies = compute_anomaly(valid_data, baseline=16.0)
report = format_anomaly_report(anomalies)
print(report)

# Each layer can be tested and modified independently! ✓

# %% [markdown]
# **Real research example**: Imagine you wrote a paper analyzing temperature data from CSV files. 
# Later, you get a grant to analyze 10 years of satellite data from a NASA database. If your analysis 
# logic is mixed with CSV parsing, you'll have to rewrite everything. If concerns are separated, you 
# just write a new `load_experiment_data()` function and reuse all the analysis code!
#
# #### Key Takeaways: Applying Design Principles
#
# These principles work together:
#
# 1. **DRY** prevents code duplication → easier maintenance
# 2. **Single Responsibility** keeps functions focused → easier testing and reuse  
# 3. **Separation of Concerns** organizes code by purpose → easier evolution
#
# **Research software benefits**:
# - **Reproduce results reliably**: Well-designed code has fewer bugs
# - **Collaborate effectively**: Team members understand clear, focused code
# - **Publish with confidence**: Reviewers can verify well-structured code
# - **Reuse in future projects**: Good design makes code portable
# - **Evolve as requirements change**: Separated concerns adapt easily
#
# **Start simple**: You don't need perfect design on day one. But as your research code grows beyond 
# a few hundred lines, applying these principles will save you countless hours of debugging and 
# refactoring. Future you will thank present you!

# ### Managing Dependencies: requirements.txt
#
# The `requirements.txt` file lists all Python packages your project needs. This is crucial for 
# reproducibility—anyone who wants to run your code can install exactly the right dependencies 
# with a single command. Think of it as a recipe: just as a cooking recipe lists ingredients, 
# `requirements.txt` lists your code's "ingredients."
#
# **Why version pinning matters**: The line `numpy>=1.20.0` means "numpy version 1.20.0 or newer." 
# This gives flexibility for minor updates while ensuring a minimum version with features you need. 
# For maximum reproducibility, you can pin exact versions: `numpy==1.20.3`. The tradeoff is between 
# flexibility (allowing updates) and reproducibility (exact versions).
#
# #### Creating requirements.txt
#
# ```bash
# # Method 1: Manually create
# # requirements.txt
# numpy>=1.20.0
# matplotlib>=3.3.0
# pandas>=1.2.0
# scipy>=1.6.0
#
# # Method 2: Generate from current environment
# pip freeze > requirements.txt
#
# # Method 3: Use pipreqs to scan your code (better!)
# pip install pipreqs
# pipreqs /path/to/project
# ```
#
# #### Installing from requirements.txt
#
# ```bash
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# ```
#
# #### Best Practices
#
# - **Pin versions** for reproducibility: `numpy==1.21.0`
# - **Use minimum versions** for flexibility: `numpy>=1.20.0`
# - **Separate dev dependencies**: Create `requirements-dev.txt` for testing tools

# %% [markdown]
# ### Conda Environment Files (environment.yml)
#
# For conda users, `environment.yml` is the equivalent of `requirements.txt`.
#
# #### Example environment.yml
#
# ```yaml
# name: my_research_env
# channels:
#   - conda-forge
#   - defaults
# dependencies:
#   - python=3.9
#   - numpy=1.21
#   - matplotlib=3.4
#   - pandas=1.3
#   - scipy=1.7
#   - jupyter
#   - pip
#   - pip:
#     - some-pip-only-package
# ```
#
# #### Using environment.yml
#
# ```bash
# # Create environment from file
# conda env create -f environment.yml
#
# # Activate the environment
# conda activate my_research_env
#
# # Export your current environment
# conda env export > environment.yml
#
# # Update environment from file
# conda env update -f environment.yml
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# ### Virtual Environments: Why and How
#
# **Virtual environments** isolate project dependencies, preventing conflicts. This is one of the 
# most important practices for reproducible research software. Without virtual environments, you're 
# installing all packages globally, and different projects can interfere with each other.
#
# #### Why Use Virtual Environments?
#
# 1. **Isolation**: Each project has its own dependencies—no interference between projects
# 2. **Reproducibility**: Lock exact versions for your project, ensuring it works the same everywhere
# 3. **No conflicts**: Project A can use NumPy 1.19, Project B can use 1.21—both work perfectly
# 4. **Clean system**: Don't clutter global Python installation with dozens of packages
# 5. **Easy cleanup**: Delete environment to remove all packages—no system-wide pollution
#
# **Real-world scenario**: Imagine you're working on two projects. One requires an older version of 
# a library (because the newer version changed its API), while another needs the latest version. 
# Without virtual environments, you're stuck—you can only have one version installed globally. With 
# virtual environments, each project gets its own isolated set of packages.
#
# #### Creating Virtual Environments
#
# **Option 1: venv (built-in, Python 3.3+)**
#
# ```bash
# # Create virtual environment
# python -m venv myenv
#
# # Activate (Linux/Mac)
# source myenv/bin/activate
#
# # Activate (Windows)
# myenv\Scripts\activate
#
# # Install packages
# pip install numpy matplotlib
#
# # Deactivate
# deactivate
# ```
#
# **Option 2: conda**
#
# ```bash
# # Create environment with specific Python version
# conda create -n myenv python=3.9
#
# # Activate
# conda activate myenv
#
# # Install packages
# conda install numpy matplotlib
#
# # Deactivate
# conda deactivate
# ```

# %%
# Check if we're in a virtual environment
import sys
import os

def check_virtual_env():
    """Check if running in a virtual environment."""
    in_venv = hasattr(sys, 'real_prefix') or (
        hasattr(sys, 'base_prefix') and sys.base_prefix != sys.prefix
    )
    
    if in_venv:
        print("✓ Running in a virtual environment")
        print(f"  Environment: {sys.prefix}")
    else:
        print("✗ Not in a virtual environment")
        print(f"  Using system Python: {sys.prefix}")
    
    print(f"  Python version: {sys.version.split()[0]}")
    print(f"  Executable: {sys.executable}")

# ### Setup.py Basics
#
# `setup.py` makes your project installable with `pip install .`
#
# #### Minimal setup.py
#
# ```python
# from setuptools import setup, find_packages
#
# setup(
#     name='my-research-project',
#     version='0.1.0',
#     author='Your Name',
#     author_email='your.email@university.edu',
#     description='Analysis tools for X research',
#     packages=find_packages(),
#     install_requires=[
#         'numpy>=1.20.0',
#         'matplotlib>=3.3.0',
#         'pandas>=1.2.0',
#     ],
#     python_requires='>=3.7',
# )
# ```
#
# #### Installing Your Package
#
# ```bash
# # Regular install
# pip install .
#
# # Editable/development install (changes reflected immediately)
# pip install -e .
#
# # Install with optional dependencies
# pip install -e ".[dev]"  # if you defined dev extras
# ```
#
# #### Why Use setup.py?
#
# - Import your code from anywhere: `from my_research_project import analysis`
# - Share with others: `pip install git+https://github.com/user/repo.git`
# - Publish to PyPI: `pip install my-research-project`

# %%
# Demonstrate what setup.py enables
# After installing with setup.py, you can do:

# Instead of:
# sys.path.append('../src')  # Fragile!
# from src import analysis

# You can simply:
# from my_research_project import analysis  # Clean!

print("setup.py enables clean, absolute imports")
print("Your package becomes a proper Python package")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Best Practices Summary: Project Structure
#
# 1. **Use a clear directory structure** - Separate source, tests, data, notebooks

# ## Part 2: Working with NumPy (30 minutes)
#
# ### Why NumPy for Scientific Computing?
#
# NumPy (Numerical Python) is the foundation of scientific computing in Python. While Python lists 
# are versatile, they're too slow for serious numerical work. NumPy arrays are implemented in C, 
# making them much faster. Think of Python lists as a filing cabinet (flexible but slow to search), 
# while NumPy arrays are like a specialized database (optimized for specific operations).
#
# **Advantages:**
# - **Speed**: 10-100x faster than pure Python lists for numerical operations
# - **Memory efficient**: Compact storage of numerical data (no Python object overhead per element)
# - **Vectorization**: Write clean code without loops—let NumPy handle the iteration in C
# - **Integration**: Works seamlessly with SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and most scientific libraries
# - **Universal**: The standard in research, industry, and education—everyone knows NumPy
#
# **When to use NumPy vs. lists**:
# - Use **lists** for: Small collections, mixed types, operations requiring Python flexibility
# - Use **NumPy** for: Large numerical datasets, mathematical operations, anything performance-critical
#
# **Use NumPy for:**
# - Numerical arrays and matrices
# - Mathematical operations on arrays
# - Linear algebra, statistics, random numbers
# - Foundation for other libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)

# ### Creating NumPy Arrays
#
# NumPy's fundamental data structure is the **ndarray** (n-dimensional array).

# %%
# Method 1: From Python lists

# np.arange(start, stop, step)
measurements = np.arange(0, 10, 2)  # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
print(f"np.arange(0, 10, 2): {measurements}")
print()

# For floats
time_points = np.arange(0.0, 5.0, 0.5)
print(f"Time points: {time_points}")
print()

# Method 3: np.linspace (linearly spaced values)
# np.linspace(start, stop, num)
# More intuitive than arange for floats
time_series = np.linspace(0, 10, 11)  # 11 points from 0 to 10
print(f"np.linspace(0, 10, 11): {time_series}")
print()

# Method 4: Arrays of zeros
zeros = np.zeros(5)

# ### NumPy Best Practices
#
# 1. **Use vectorization** - Avoid Python loops, use NumPy operations
# 2. **Preallocate arrays** - Use `np.zeros()` or `np.empty()` instead of appending
# 3. **Use appropriate dtypes** - `float32` vs `float64`, `int32` vs `int64`
# 4. **Broadcasting** - NumPy automatically broadcasts arrays of different shapes
# 5. **In-place operations** - Use `+=`, `-=` to save memory
# 6. **Use built-in functions** - NumPy functions are optimized (C/Fortran)
# 7. **Boolean indexing** - Elegant filtering without loops

# ### Best Practices for Publication-Quality Figures
#
# **1. Resolution and Format**
# - Use **300+ DPI** for raster images (PNG, JPG)
# - Prefer **vector formats** (PDF, SVG, EPS) for publications
# - PNG for web/presentations, PDF/SVG for papers
#
# **2. Fonts and Labels**
# - Use **clear, readable fonts** (11-14pt)
# - **Bold axis labels and titles**
# - Include **units** in axis labels
# - Use **descriptive titles**
#
# **3. Colors**
# - Use **colorblind-friendly palettes**
# - Consider **grayscale printing**
# - Avoid too many colors (3-5 max)
# - Use **consistent colors** across figures
#
# **4. Data Presentation**
# - Always include **error bars** when appropriate
# - Add **legends** for multiple series
# - Use **grid lines** sparingly (subtle, alpha < 0.5)
# - Show **raw data points** when possible
#
# **5. Size and Layout**
# - Match **journal column width** (typically 3.5" or 7" wide)
# - Use **aspect ratios** that fit the data (not always square)
# - `tight_layout()` or `bbox_inches='tight'` to avoid cropping
#
# **6. Accessibility**
# - Use **markers** and **line styles**, not just colors
# - Add **annotations** for key features
# - Keep it **simple** - remove chart junk
# - Test in **grayscale**

# %%

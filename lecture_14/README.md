# Lecture 14: Course Summary and the RSE Community

## Overview
This final half-lecture wraps up our Research Software Engineering journey by reviewing what we've learned, exploring important topics we didn't cover, and connecting you with the broader RSE community. This session provides perspective on how the course content fits together and how you can continue growing as a research software engineer.

**Duration**: 45-60 minutes (half-lecture)

**Note**: This lecture will be augmented later with information about the course exam, further educational offers, and a Q&A session.

## Topics Covered
- Comprehensive review of Lectures 1-13
- How all course concepts fit together
- Advanced topics beyond this course
- The international RSE community
- German RSE community and local resources
- Continuing education opportunities
- Where to find ongoing support and resources

## Key Concepts
- **Course integration**: How version control, testing, CI/CD, and documentation work together
- **RSE community**: Society of Research Software Engineering and local chapters
- **Career paths**: Academic, industry, and hybrid RSE roles
- **Continuous learning**: Staying current with evolving best practices
- **Community support**: Conferences, working groups, and online resources

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lecture, you should have:
- Completed Lectures 1-13
- Hands-on experience with the RSE tools and practices covered
- Basic understanding of all major topics: version control, Python, testing, CI/CD, documentation, containers, collaboration, data management, workflows, and AI tools

This final lecture synthesizes everything you've learned into a cohesive whole.

## Learning Objectives
- Review and integrate knowledge from all 13 lectures
- Understand advanced topics beyond this course and how to learn them
- Connect with the international and German RSE communities
- Know where to find ongoing support and resources
- Feel confident continuing your RSE journey

## Files
- `lecture_14.py` - Main lecture content in Jupytext format
- `environment.yml` - Additional dependencies (none beyond base)

## Running the Lecture

1. Create and activate the lecture 14 environment:
```bash
cd /path/to/RSE_lecture
make install-lecture14
micromamba activate rse_lecture
```

Or manually:
```bash
micromamba env create -f environment.yml
micromamba env update -f lecture_14/environment.yml
micromamba activate rse_lecture
```

2. Convert to notebook and run:
```bash

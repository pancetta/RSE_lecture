# ## Part 1: Course Summary - What We've Learned
#
# ### The Complete Journey (Lectures 1-13)
#
# Over the past 13 lectures, we've covered a comprehensive path from basic tools to
# professional research software engineering practices. Let's review what we've learned
# and how it all fits together.
#

# ## Part 2: Important Topics We Didn't Cover
#
# ### Why We Can't Cover Everything
#
# Research software engineering is a vast field that intersects with computer science,
# software engineering, and domain-specific research. A comprehensive course would take
# years, not weeks. We've focused on **foundational skills that apply broadly** rather
# than specialized topics that serve narrower audiences.
#
# The topics below are important, but they either:
# - Require the foundations we've built (you're now ready to learn them)
# - Are specific to certain research domains
# - Are rapidly evolving (better learned when you need them)
# - Are too advanced for an introductory course
#
# ### Advanced Software Engineering
#
# **Topics**:
# - Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
# - Design patterns (factory, observer, strategy, etc.)
# - Software architecture (microservices, event-driven, layered)
# - Type systems and static typing (mypy, type hints)
# - Functional programming patterns
#
# **Why we didn't cover them**:
# - You need strong Python fundamentals first (which you now have)
# - Design patterns make more sense with real project experience
# - Many research scripts don't require complex architecture
# - These topics are better learned in context of a specific project
#
# **How to learn more**:
# - *Clean Code* by Robert C. Martin
# - *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* by Gang of Four
# - *Fluent Python* by Luciano Ramalho (excellent for advanced Python)
# - *Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code* by Martin Fowler
# - Real Python: https://realpython.com (excellent tutorials on advanced Python)
#
# ### High-Performance Computing (HPC)
#
# **Topics**:
# - Parallel programming (OpenMP, MPI)
# - GPU computing (CUDA, OpenCL, ROCm)
# - Job scheduling systems (SLURM, PBS, LSF)
# - HPC cluster architecture
# - Performance optimization for HPC
#
# **Why we didn't cover them**:
# - HPC is a specialized domain (not all RSEs work on HPC)
# - Requires significant computational resources
# - Often domain-specific (computational chemistry vs. climate modeling)
# - Better taught by HPC centers with hands-on cluster access
#
# **How to learn more**:
# - *Parallel Programming in Science and Engineering* by Demmel et al.
# - LLNL HPC Tutorials: https://hpc.llnl.gov/documentation/tutorials
# - ARCHER2 Training: https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/

#
# **Topics**:
# - Web frameworks (Flask, Django, FastAPI)
# - JavaScript and frontend development

# - Database design and ORM
# - Web deployment and hosting
#
# **Why we didn't cover them**:
# - Not all research software needs a web interface
# - Web development is a deep specialization
# - Rapidly evolving technologies
# - Many research projects use existing platforms rather than custom web apps
#
# **How to learn more**:
# - *Flask Web Development* by Miguel Grinberg

# - R for statistical analysis
# - Rust for systems programming
#
# **Why we didn't cover them**:

# - Learning programming concepts matters more than syntax
# - Most RSE work uses Python or requires interfacing with Python
# - Specialized languages are better learned when needed for a specific project
#
# **How to learn more**:
# - *The C Programming Language* by Kernighan and Ritchie (classic)
# - Learn C++: https://www.learncpp.com/

# - Security threats evolve rapidly
# - Basic security (not committing secrets) was covered in version control
#
# **How to learn more**:
# - OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project): https://owasp.org/

# - Alternative version control systems (Mercurial, Perforce)
#
# **Why we didn't cover them**:
# - Basic Git covers 95% of daily work
# - Advanced topics can be confusing without solid Git fundamentals
# - History rewriting is dangerous if misused
# - Better learned when you encounter specific needs
#
# **How to learn more**:
# - *Pro Git* by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub (free online)
# - Git documentation: https://git-scm.com/doc
# - GitHub Git Guides: https://github.com/git-guides

# - Climate science: xarray, Climate Data Operators (CDO)
# - Astronomy: Astropy, FITS file handling
# - Social sciences: NetworkX, graph analysis tools
#
# **Why we didn't cover them**:
# - Each research domain has unique software ecosystems
# - Tool landscape changes based on field

# **Academic Research**:
# - PhD work with strong computational component
# - Postdoctoral research in computational fields
# - Research scientist positions
# - Group leader in computational research
#
# **RSE Career Track**:
# - RSE positions at universities and research centers
# - HPC centers (computational science and engineering)
# - Core facilities and shared infrastructure
# - Scientific software development teams
#
# **Industry Transitions**:
# - Data science and analytics
# - Software engineering at tech companies
# - Scientific computing in industry (pharma, finance, aerospace)
# - Developer relations and technical writing
#
# **Education and Training**:
# - Teaching computational methods
# - Developing training materials
# - Software Carpentry instruction
# - Technical workshop facilitation
#
# RSE skills are increasingly valued—many institutions are creating dedicated RSE
# positions recognizing that good software is essential to modern research.
#
# ### Final Thoughts
#
# **You've learned a lot**. From command-line basics to AI-assisted development,
# from writing your first Python function to setting up CI/CD pipelines. These skills
# will serve you throughout your research career.
#
# **You're part of a community**. RSE isn't practiced in isolation. Connect with the
# de-RSE community, attend events, ask questions, and share what you learn.
#
# **Software is research**. The code you write, the tools you build, the workflows you
# create—these are research outputs as valuable as papers. Treat them professionally.
#
# **Keep learning**. Technology changes, but the principles remain. Stay curious, try
# new tools, and always ask "is there a better way?"
#
# **Be patient with yourself**. Becoming proficient at RSE takes time and practice. You
# will make mistakes, write bad code, and break things. That's part of learning.
#
# **Share your knowledge**. When you've learned something, help others learn it too.
# The RSE community grows stronger when we support each other.

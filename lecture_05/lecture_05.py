# ## Part 1: A Cautionary Tale - The Temperature Conversion Disaster
# 
# ### The Story
# 
# In 2020, a climate research team published a groundbreaking paper suggesting unexpected warming
# patterns in the Arctic. The paper received significant media attention and influenced policy
# discussions. Six months later, another team tried to reproduce the results and discovered a
# critical bug: **the temperature conversion function had a subtle error**.
# 
# The original team had to retract their paper. Years of work were lost. Careers were damaged.
# Policy decisions made based on the flawed data had to be reversed. All because of a simple,
# untested function.
# 
# ### The Flawed Code
# 
# Let's look at the type of code that caused this disaster:

# %%
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
    """Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit."""
    return celsius * 9 / 5 + 32


def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
    """Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius."""
    # BUG: This should be (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
    return (fahrenheit - 32) * 9 / 5  # Wrong formula!


def calculate_temperature_anomaly(temperatures_f, baseline_f):
    """
    Calculate temperature anomaly relative to baseline.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    temperatures_f : list
        List of temperatures in Fahrenheit
    baseline_f : float
        Baseline temperature in Fahrenheit
        
    Returns
    -------
    list
        Temperature anomalies in Celsius
    """
    anomalies = []
    for temp in temperatures_f:
        # Convert to Celsius
        temp_c = fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp)
        baseline_c = fahrenheit_to_celsius(baseline_f)
        # Calculate anomaly
        anomaly = temp_c - baseline_c
        anomalies.append(anomaly)
    return anomalies


# Let's use this function with real-looking data
observed_temps = [32.5, 33.0, 34.2, 35.1, 33.8]
baseline_temp = 32.0

anomalies = calculate_temperature_anomaly(observed_temps, baseline_temp)
print(f"Temperature anomalies: {anomalies}")
print(f"Average anomaly: {sum(anomalies) / len(anomalies):.2f}°C")

# %% [markdown]
# ### What Went Wrong?
# 
# The bug in `fahrenheit_to_celsius` multiplies by 9/5 instead of 5/9. This error:
# 
# 1. **Wasn't immediately obvious** - the function still returns numbers
# 2. **Wasn't caught during development** - no tests were written
# 3. **Wasn't caught during review** - reviewers didn't verify the formula
# 4. **Produced plausible-looking results** - the values seemed reasonable at first glance
# 5. **Compounded through the analysis** - every calculation using this function was wrong
# 
# This is exactly the kind of error that **testing prevents**. Let's see how.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Code Smells: Warning Signs of Design Problems
# 
# Before we learn about testing, let's talk about **code smells**—characteristics of code that 
# suggest deeper problems. The term was coined by Kent Beck and popularized by Martin Fowler in his 
# book *Refactoring*. A code smell isn't a bug (the code might work perfectly), but it indicates 
# that the code will be hard to maintain, test, or understand.
# 
# **Why this matters for testing**: Code that smells bad is often hard or impossible to test. If 
# you find yourself struggling to write tests, the problem might not be with your testing approach—
# it might be that your code has design problems. Learning to recognize code smells helps you write 
# more testable, maintainable code from the start.
# 
# **The connection**: Well-designed code is testable code. If your code is hard to test, it's 
# probably poorly designed. Code smells are your early warning system.
# 
# #### Common Code Smells in Research Software
# 
# Let's examine the most common smells in research code, with examples:
# 
# **1. God Function (or "Long Function")**
# 
# A function that does everything—hundreds of lines, multiple responsibilities, impossible to 
# understand or test.

# %%
# CODE SMELL: God Function ❌
def analyze_experiment(data_file, config_file, output_dir):
    """Analyze experimental data... but what does this really do?"""
    # Read configuration (50 lines)
    # Load data from file (40 lines)
    # Clean and validate data (60 lines)
    # Apply multiple transformations (80 lines)
    # Calculate statistics (50 lines)
    # Generate plots (70 lines)
    # Save results (40 lines)
    # Email notification (30 lines)
    # Total: 420 lines in ONE function!
    
    # How do you test this? Where do bugs hide?
    # Can you reuse any part of this?
    # Can you understand what it does 6 months from now?
    pass  # Imagine 420 lines here...

# %% [markdown]
# **Why it smells**: 
# - Hard to test (must set up files, configs, email server...)
# - Hard to debug (bug could be anywhere in 420 lines)
# - Hard to reuse (all or nothing)
# - Hard to understand (what's the main logic vs details?)
# 
# **The fix**: Break into smaller, focused functions (like we learned in Lecture 4's Single 
# Responsibility Principle).
# 
# **2. Duplicated Code**
# 
# Copy-pasted code that appears in multiple places. We saw this in Lecture 4 with DRY principle.

# %%
# CODE SMELL: Duplicated code ❌
def analyze_temperature_2019(temps):
    total = 0
    for t in temps:
        total += t
    mean = total / len(temps)
    
    squared_diffs = 0
    for t in temps:
        squared_diffs += (t - mean) ** 2
    variance = squared_diffs / len(temps)
    return {'mean': mean, 'variance': variance}

def analyze_temperature_2020(temps):
    total = 0
    for t in temps:
        total += t
    mean = total / len(temps)
    
    squared_diffs = 0
    for t in temps:
        squared_diffs += (t - mean) ** 2
    variance = squared_diffs / len(temps)
    return {'mean': mean, 'variance': variance}

# Same logic, copied and pasted! Bug in one = bug in both (probably)

# %% [markdown]
# **Why it smells**:
# - Bug fixes must be applied multiple times
# - Easy to miss one copy when updating
# - More code to test and maintain
# 
# **The fix**: Extract common logic into a shared function (DRY principle).
# 
# **3. Magic Numbers and Unclear Names**
# 
# Numbers or strings that appear without explanation, or variables named `x`, `tmp`, `data2`.

# %%
# CODE SMELL: Magic numbers and unclear names ❌
def process(x, y):
    """Process... what? How?"""
    if x > 273.15:  # What is 273.15?
        z = x * 1.8 + 32  # What is this calculating?
        if z > 200:  # Why 200?
            return z * 0.5  # Why multiply by 0.5?
    return y

# What does this function do? Impossible to tell without detective work!

# BETTER: Self-documenting code ✓
ABSOLUTE_ZERO_KELVIN = 273.15
EXTREME_TEMP_FAHRENHEIT = 200
ADJUSTMENT_FACTOR = 0.5

def convert_temperature_with_bounds(temp_kelvin, fallback_value):
    """Convert Kelvin to Fahrenheit with bounds checking."""
    if temp_kelvin > ABSOLUTE_ZERO_KELVIN:
        temp_fahrenheit = temp_kelvin * 1.8 + 32
        
        if temp_fahrenheit > EXTREME_TEMP_FAHRENHEIT:
            return temp_fahrenheit * ADJUSTMENT_FACTOR
    
    return fallback_value

# Now it's clear what the function does and why!

# %% [markdown]
# **Why it smells**:
# - Hard to understand intent
# - Easy to misuse or misunderstand
# - Harder to modify (what was 273.15 again?)
# 
# **The fix**: Use named constants and descriptive variable names.
# 
# **4. Tight Coupling (or "Feature Envy")**
# 
# Functions that reach deep into other objects or modules, creating dependencies that make testing 
# difficult.

# %%
# CODE SMELL: Tight coupling ❌
class ExperimentData:
    def __init__(self):
        self.temps = [15.2, 16.8, 14.5]
        self.pressures = [1013, 1015, 1012]

def analyze_data_badly(experiment):
    """This function knows too much about ExperimentData's internals."""
    # Directly accessing internal data structures
    mean_temp = sum(experiment.temps) / len(experiment.temps)
    mean_pressure = sum(experiment.pressures) / len(experiment.pressures)
    
    # What if ExperimentData changes how it stores data?
    # This function breaks! Testing requires creating full ExperimentData objects.
    return mean_temp, mean_pressure

# BETTER: Loose coupling ✓
def calculate_mean(values):
    """Generic function, works with any list."""
    return sum(values) / len(values)

# Now you can test calculate_mean with simple lists!
# ExperimentData can change internals without breaking this function.

# %% [markdown]
# **Why it smells**:
# - Hard to test (need to create complex objects)
# - Fragile (breaks when other code changes)
# - Hard to reuse (tied to specific data structures)
# 
# **The fix**: Depend on abstractions, not implementations. Accept simple parameters.
# 
# **5. Global State and Hidden Dependencies**
# 
# Functions that read or modify global variables, making behavior unpredictable and testing 
# difficult.

# %%
# CODE SMELL: Global state ❌
BASELINE_TEMPERATURE = 15.0  # Global variable

def calculate_anomaly_bad(temp):
    """Uses global state - hard to test and reason about."""
    return temp - BASELINE_TEMPERATURE

# What happens when multiple analyses need different baselines?
# How do you test this with different baselines?
# Whoever changes BASELINE_TEMPERATURE affects all code!

# BETTER: Explicit dependencies ✓
def calculate_anomaly_good(temp, baseline):
    """Baseline is explicit parameter - easy to test and reuse."""
    return temp - baseline

# Test with any baseline you want!
assert calculate_anomaly_good(20, 15) == 5
assert calculate_anomaly_good(20, 18) == 2

# %% [markdown]
# **Why it smells**:
# - Unpredictable behavior (depends on hidden state)
# - Hard to test (must set up global state)
# - Causes action-at-a-distance bugs (changing one place breaks another)
# 
# **The fix**: Make dependencies explicit through parameters.
# 
# #### Code Smell Quick Reference
# 
# | Smell | Red Flag | Impact on Testing | Fix |
# |-------|----------|------------------|-----|
# | **God Function** | Function > 50 lines, multiple tasks | Setup complex, many tests needed | Split into focused functions |
# | **Duplicated Code** | Copy-pasted logic | Must test same logic multiple times | Extract to shared function (DRY) |
# | **Magic Numbers** | Unexplained constants like `273.15` | Tests unclear without context | Named constants |
# | **Tight Coupling** | Function accesses deep internals | Requires complex object setup | Accept simple parameters |
# | **Global State** | Reads/writes global variables | Tests interfere with each other | Explicit parameters |
# | **Poor Naming** | Variables like `x`, `tmp`, `data2` | Hard to write meaningful test names | Descriptive names |
# 
# #### Spotting Code Smells in Practice
# 
# Let's apply this to our temperature conversion disaster. Look at the original code again:

# %%
# From our cautionary tale - can you spot the code smells?
def fahrenheit_to_celsius_smelly(fahrenheit):
    """Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius."""
    return (fahrenheit - 32) * 9 / 5  # Bug: should be 5/9

def calculate_temperature_anomaly_smelly(temperatures_f, baseline_f):
    """Calculate temperature anomaly relative to baseline."""
    anomalies = []
    for temp in temperatures_f:
        temp_c = fahrenheit_to_celsius_smelly(temp)
        baseline_c = fahrenheit_to_celsius_smelly(baseline_f)  # SMELL: Duplicated calculation!
        anomaly = temp_c - baseline_c
        anomalies.append(anomaly)
    return anomalies

# %% [markdown]
# **Smells identified**:
# 
# 1. **Duplicated calculation**: `fahrenheit_to_celsius(baseline_f)` is called in every loop 
#    iteration, but the result never changes! This is wasteful and obscures intent.
#    
# 2. **Magic number**: The `32` and fractions aren't explained. A comment would help, or better 
#    yet, named constants like `FAHRENHEIT_OFFSET = 32`.
#    
# 3. **Not obvious that conversion is wrong**: Without tests, the formula error went unnoticed. 
#    The function "smells okay" at first glance but has a subtle bug.
# 
# **Better version**:

# %%
# Cleaned up - smells removed ✓
FAHRENHEIT_OFFSET = 32
FAHRENHEIT_TO_CELSIUS_RATIO = 5 / 9

def fahrenheit_to_celsius_clean(fahrenheit):
    """Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using standard formula."""
    return (fahrenheit - FAHRENHEIT_OFFSET) * FAHRENHEIT_TO_CELSIUS_RATIO

def calculate_temperature_anomaly_clean(temperatures_f, baseline_f):
    """Calculate temperature anomalies relative to baseline, all in Celsius."""
    # Calculate baseline once, not in loop!
    baseline_c = fahrenheit_to_celsius_clean(baseline_f)
    
    anomalies = []
    for temp_f in temperatures_f:
        temp_c = fahrenheit_to_celsius_clean(temp_f)
        anomaly = temp_c - baseline_c
        anomalies.append(anomaly)
    
    return anomalies

# Now the code is clearer and more testable!

# %% [markdown]
# #### The Testing Connection: Smelly Code is Hard to Test
# 
# Here's the key insight: **If your code is hard to test, it probably has design problems.**
# 
# **Signs that code smells are making testing hard**:
# - "I need to create 5 objects just to test this one function"  
#   → Probably tight coupling
# - "I can't test this without reading/writing files"  
#   → Probably mixing I/O with logic (separation of concerns)
# - "My test breaks when I change unrelated code"  
#   → Probably global state or tight coupling
# - "I need to mock 10 different things to test this"  
#   → Probably god function doing too much
# - "I don't know what to name this test"  
#   → Probably unclear what the function does (poor naming)
# 
# **Good news**: Testable code is well-designed code. When you write tests, you naturally improve 
# your design because:
# - You need simple interfaces (avoid coupling)
# - You need predictable behavior (avoid global state)
# - You need focused functionality (avoid god functions)
# - You need clear contracts (good naming and documentation)
# 
# **Next step**: Now that we recognize code smells, let's learn how to prevent them through 
# systematic testing. Tests not only catch bugs—they guide you toward better design!
# 
# **Further reading on code smells**:

# - Robert C. Martin, *Clean Code* (2008) - Chapters 3, 6, 10 on functions, objects, and classes

#     <p>The best way to learn testing is to catch real bugs—let's hunt!</p>
#     <ul>
#         <li><strong>Write tests that catch the disaster:</strong> Before looking at the
#         solution, write comprehensive tests for the buggy fahrenheit_to_celsius
#         function—see if you can create a test suite that would have caught the bug before
#         publication.</li>
#         <li><strong>Test your own research code:</strong> Pick a critical function from
#         your current project and write 3-5 tests for it—edge cases, typical inputs, and
#         error conditions. You might discover bugs you didn't know existed!</li>
#         <li><strong>Practice test-first thinking:</strong> Choose a new small feature you
#         need and write the tests BEFORE implementing it—experience how tests clarify
#         requirements and guide design.</li>

# ## Part 2: Introduction to Testing
# 
# ### Why Test Research Software?
# 
# Research software is often perceived as "write once, run once" code that doesn't need testing. 
# This is a dangerous misconception. In reality, research code is modified constantly, used with 
# different datasets, and often reused in future projects. Without tests, every change is a potential 
# source of bugs that can silently corrupt your results.
# 
# **Research is iterative**: You'll run and modify your code many times as you refine your analysis
# - **Data changes**: New data might expose edge cases your code doesn't handle
# - **Collaborators need confidence**: Others must trust your results to build on them
# - **You might be wrong**: Even experts make mistakes (as our story shows)—tests catch them
# - **Future you needs help**: You'll forget the implementation details in 6 months; tests document behavior
# - **Journals increasingly require it**: Many publishers now expect code and tests to be available
# 
# **Testing mindset**: Think of tests as "documentation that runs." They show how your code is 
# supposed to work and prove that it does. Good tests make refactoring safe—you can improve your 
# code's implementation without breaking its behavior.
# 
# ### Real-World Research Software Failures
# 
# Our story is fictional, but based on real incidents:
# 
# 1. **Geoffrey Chang (2006)**: Retracted 5 papers from *Science* due to a data column flip
# 2. **Reinhart-Rogoff (2010)**: Excel error affected global economic policy
# 3. **Mars Climate Orbiter (1999)**: $327M loss due to unit conversion error
# 4. **Ariane 5 (1996)**: $370M rocket destroyed by integer overflow
# 
# ### Types of Testing
# 
# Testing comes in different forms, each serving a specific purpose:
# 
# - **Unit tests**: Test individual functions in isolation—does this one function work correctly?
# - **Integration tests**: Test how components work together—do these functions interact properly?
# - **Regression tests**: Ensure bugs don't come back—once fixed, stay fixed
# - **Acceptance tests**: Verify the software meets requirements—does it solve the right problem?
# 
# Today we focus on **unit tests**—the foundation of testing. Unit tests are small, fast, and test 
# one specific piece of functionality. They're the most common type of test and the easiest to write. 
# 
# **Testing pyramid**: Most projects should have many unit tests (fast, easy to write), fewer 
# integration tests (slower, test interactions), and a few acceptance tests (slowest, test whole 
# system). Start with unit tests—they give you the most value for the least effort.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 3: Writing Your First Test
# 
# ### Manual Testing (What NOT to Do)
# 
# Before learning proper testing, let's see what manual testing looks like:

# %%
# Manual testing - fragile and non-repeatable
print("Testing celsius_to_fahrenheit...")
result = celsius_to_fahrenheit(0)
if result == 32:
    print("✓ Freezing point test passed")
else:
    print(f"✗ Freezing point test FAILED: expected 32, got {result}")

result = celsius_to_fahrenheit(100)
if result == 212:
    print("✓ Boiling point test passed")
else:
    print(f"✗ Boiling point test FAILED: expected 212, got {result}")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Problems with Manual Testing
# 
# 1. **Not automated**: You must run it manually every time—easy to forget or skip
# 2. **Not organized**: Tests scattered throughout code—hard to maintain
# 3. **Not comprehensive**: Easy to forget edge cases—what about negative numbers? zero? infinity?
# 4. **Not persistent**: Tests lost when cells are re-run—no record of what was tested
# 5. **No clear pass/fail**: Must interpret output yourself—did all tests pass?
# 
# **Why this matters**: Manual testing is how bugs slip through. You test the happy path (normal 
# inputs) but forget edge cases. You test once but don't re-test after changes. You test locally 
# but not on different systems. Automated testing solves all these problems.
# 
# %% [markdown]
# ### Using pytest - The Right Way
# 
# `pytest` is Python's most popular testing framework. It makes testing easy and automatic. Unlike 
# manual testing, pytest discovers and runs all your tests automatically, provides clear pass/fail 
# output, and integrates with CI/CD systems.
# 
# **Why pytest over alternatives?**:
# - **Simple**: Just write functions starting with `test_` and use `assert`
# - **Powerful**: Advanced features like fixtures and parametrization when you need them
# - **Fast**: Runs tests in parallel and caches results
# - **Popular**: Huge ecosystem of plugins and community support
# 
# **Best practice**: Keep test files separate from source code. Put them in a `tests/` directory with 
# names like `test_module.py`. This keeps your source code clean and makes tests easy to find.

# %%
# First, let's write tests in a format pytest can discover
# In practice, these would be in a separate file: test_temperature.py

def test_celsius_to_fahrenheit_freezing():
    """Test conversion at water freezing point."""
    assert celsius_to_fahrenheit(0) == 32


def test_celsius_to_fahrenheit_boiling():
    """Test conversion at water boiling point."""
    assert celsius_to_fahrenheit(100) == 212


def test_celsius_to_fahrenheit_negative():
    """Test conversion with negative temperature."""

    test_celsius_to_fahrenheit_negative()
    print("✓ Negative temperature test passed")
except AssertionError as e:
    print(f"✗ Negative temperature test FAILED: {e}")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Understanding Assertions
# 
# An **assertion** is a statement that must be true. If it's false, Python raises an `AssertionError`.
# 
# ```python
# assert condition, "Optional error message"
# ```
# 
# **Good assertions are:**
# - Clear: Easy to understand what's being tested
# - Specific: Test one thing at a time
# - Meaningful: Include helpful error messages
# 
# **Common assertion patterns:**

# %%
def test_assertion_patterns():
    """Demonstrate common assertion patterns."""
    
    # Equality
    assert celsius_to_fahrenheit(0) == 32
    
    # Approximate equality (for floating point)
    result = celsius_to_fahrenheit(37)
    expected = 98.6
    assert abs(result - expected) < 0.01, f"Expected {expected}, got {result}"
    
    # Type checking
    result = celsius_to_fahrenheit(0)
    assert isinstance(result, (int, float)), f"Expected numeric type, got {type(result)}"
    
    # Range checking

# ## Part 6: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
# 
# ### The TDD Cycle: Red-Green-Refactor
# 
# Test-Driven Development follows a simple cycle:
# 
# 1. **Red**: Write a test that fails (because feature doesn't exist yet)
# 2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
# 3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests passing
# 4. **Repeat**: Add next test
# 
# ### TDD Example: Temperature Statistics
# 
# Let's use TDD to build a function that calculates temperature statistics:

# %%
# STEP 1 (RED): Write the test FIRST (it will fail)

def test_temperature_statistics_mean():
    """Test mean temperature calculation."""
    temps = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]
    stats = temperature_statistics(temps)
    assert abs(stats['mean'] - 20) < 0.01


# STEP 2 (GREEN): Write minimal code to pass the test

def temperature_statistics(temperatures):
    """Calculate statistics for a list of temperatures."""
    return {
        'mean': sum(temperatures) / len(temperatures)
    }


# Verify the test passes
try:
    test_temperature_statistics_mean()
    print("✓ Mean temperature test passed")
except (AssertionError, NameError) as e:
    print(f"✗ Mean temperature test failed: {e}")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Adding More Features with TDD

# %%
# STEP 1 (RED): Add test for standard deviation

def test_temperature_statistics_std():
    """Test standard deviation calculation."""
    temps = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]
    stats = temperature_statistics_extended(temps)
    # Expected std ≈ 14.14
    assert abs(stats['std'] - 14.14) < 0.1


# STEP 2 (GREEN): Extend function to calculate std

def temperature_statistics_extended(temperatures):
    """Calculate statistics for a list of temperatures."""
    n = len(temperatures)
    mean = sum(temperatures) / n
    variance = sum((t - mean) ** 2 for t in temperatures) / n
    std = variance ** 0.5
    
    return {
        'mean': mean,
        'std': std
    }


# Verify tests pass
try:
    # Update to use extended version
    temps = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]
    stats = temperature_statistics_extended(temps)
    assert abs(stats['mean'] - 20) < 0.01
    print("✓ Mean temperature test passed")
except (AssertionError, NameError) as e:
    print(f"✗ Mean temperature test failed: {e}")

try:
    test_temperature_statistics_std()
    print("✓ Std temperature test passed")
except (AssertionError, NameError) as e:
    print(f"✗ Std temperature test failed: {e}")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Benefits of TDD
# 
# Test-Driven Development might feel backward at first (write tests before code?!), but it has 
# profound benefits:
# 
# 1. **Clear requirements**: Tests define what the code should do before you write it—no ambiguity
# 2. **Confidence**: You know your code works because you've tested every feature as you built it
# 3. **Documentation**: Tests show how to use the code—they're executable examples
# 4. **Design**: Writing tests first leads to better code design—testable code is usually good code
# 5. **Regression prevention**: Tests catch bugs when changing code—refactor fearlessly
# 
# **When to use TDD**: TDD is especially valuable for algorithmic code, data processing, or any logic-
# heavy code where correctness is critical. For exploratory research, you might start without TDD 
# and add tests as your code stabilizes. The key is to eventually have tests, even if you don't 
# write them first.
# 
# **Common misconception**: TDD doesn't mean "write ALL tests first, then ALL code." It means work 
# in small cycles: one test, just enough code to pass it, repeat. Each cycle takes minutes, not days.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 7: Test Coverage
# 
# ### What is Test Coverage?
# 
# **Test coverage** measures which lines of code are executed during testing. It's a metric that 
# tells you how much of your code is actually being tested. Think of it as a quality check for your 
# test suite.
# 
# - **100% coverage**: Every line is tested—but this doesn't mean bug-free!
# - **<100% coverage**: Some code is untested—potential bugs hiding there
# 
# **Important caveat**: High coverage doesn't guarantee correctness. You can have 100% coverage 
# with terrible tests that don't assert anything meaningful. Coverage tells you what's tested, not 
# whether it's tested well. It's a necessary but not sufficient condition for quality.
# 
# **Coverage targets**: Aim for 80-90% coverage for research software. 100% is often not worth the 
# effort—some code (like logging or error messages) is hard to test meaningfully. Focus on testing 
# your core scientific logic comprehensively.
# 
# ### Measuring Coverage with pytest-cov
# 
# Use `pytest-cov` to measure coverage. This plugin integrates with pytest to track which lines 
# run during tests and generates reports showing untested code.
# 
# ```bash
# # Run tests with coverage report
# pytest --cov=src tests/
# 
# # Generate HTML coverage report (easier to read, highlights untested lines)
# pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html tests/
# 
# # Set minimum coverage threshold (fails if below 80%)
# pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80 tests/
# ```
# 
# **Reading coverage reports**: The HTML report shows your code with green (tested) and red (untested) 
# highlighting. Look for red sections—those are your blind spots. Prioritize testing branches (if/else), 
# loops, and error handling paths.
# 
# **Coverage in CI/CD**: Add coverage checks to your CI pipeline with `--cov-fail-under`. This ensures 
# coverage doesn't drop over time. Many projects display a coverage badge in their README showing 
# their coverage percentage—it's a quality signal to users.
# 
# ### Coverage Example

# ## Summary: What We Learned
# 
# ### The Journey
# 
# 1. **Started with disaster**: Untested code with a critical bug
# 2. **Learned about testing**: Why it matters, especially in research
# 3. **Wrote our first tests**: Using pytest and assertions
# 4. **Found and fixed bugs**: Tests revealed the formula error
# 5. **Applied TDD**: Write tests first, then implementation
# 6. **Measured coverage**: Ensured all code paths tested
# 7. **Added defensive programming**: Assertions in production code
# 8. **Built comprehensive suite**: Full test coverage of corrected code
# 
# ### Key Takeaways
# 
# ✅ **Always test research software** - your career may depend on it  
# ✅ **Write tests early** - before bugs cause problems  
# ✅ **Use pytest** - it makes testing easy and automatic  
# ✅ **Aim for high coverage** - test all code paths  
# ✅ **Use assertions** - catch bugs at the source  
# ✅ **TDD works** - write tests first for better design  
# ✅ **Tests are documentation** - they show how code should work  
# 
# ### Testing Best Practices for Research
# 
# 1. **Test scientific correctness**: Verify formulas and algorithms
# 2. **Test edge cases**: Boundary conditions, empty inputs, extreme values
# 3. **Test with known results**: Use published data or hand-calculated examples
# 4. **Keep tests simple**: One assertion per test when possible
# 5. **Run tests often**: Before committing, after changes, in CI
# 6. **Don't skip testing**: Even "simple" functions can have bugs
# 
# ### Testing in Other Programming Languages
# 
# While this lecture focused on Python and pytest, **every modern programming language has
# testing frameworks**. Here's what to look for in other languages you might use for research:
# 
# **C/C++**
# - **Popular frameworks**: Google Test (gtest), Catch2, CppUnit, Boost.Test
# - **What to look for**: Unit testing with assertions, test fixtures, mocking
# - **Example**: `ASSERT_EQ(celsius_to_fahrenheit(0), 32);`
# - **Note**: More manual setup than Python, but same concepts apply
# 
# **Java**
# - **Popular frameworks**: JUnit (most common), TestNG, AssertJ
# - **What to look for**: Annotations like `@Test`, assertions, test runners
# - **Example**: `@Test public void testCelsiusToFahrenheit() { assertEquals(32, celsiusToFahrenheit(0)); }`
# - **Note**: Integrated into most Java IDEs
# 
# **Julia**
# - **Built-in testing**: `Test` standard library (no external install needed)
# - **What to look for**: `@test` macro, `@testset` for grouping
# - **Example**: `@test celsius_to_fahrenheit(0) ≈ 32`
# - **Note**: Very Pythonic feel, easy to get started
# 
# **R**
# - **Popular frameworks**: testthat (most popular), RUnit, tinytest
# - **What to look for**: `test_that()` function, expectations like `expect_equal()`
# - **Example**: `test_that("conversion works", { expect_equal(celsius_to_fahrenheit(0), 32) })`
# - **Note**: Well integrated with RStudio and package development
# 
# **JavaScript/TypeScript**
# - **Popular frameworks**: Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, Vitest
# - **What to look for**: `describe()` and `it()` blocks, assertions with `expect()`
# - **Example**: `expect(celsiusToFahrenheit(0)).toBe(32);`
# - **Note**: Essential for web-based research tools
# 
# **Fortran**
# - **Popular frameworks**: pFUnit, FRUIT, Funit
# - **What to look for**: Test suites, assertions, fixtures
# - **Example**: `@assertEqual(32.0, celsius_to_fahrenheit(0.0))`
# - **Note**: Yes, even Fortran has modern testing frameworks!
# 
# **MATLAB**
# - **Built-in testing**: Unit Testing Framework (no toolbox required in modern versions)
# - **What to look for**: `matlab.unittest.TestCase`, `verifyEqual()`
# - **Example**: `testCase.verifyEqual(celsiusToFahrenheit(0), 32)`
# - **Note**: Integrated with MATLAB IDE
# 
# **Rust**
# - **Built-in testing**: Part of the language itself
# - **What to look for**: `#[test]` attribute, `assert_eq!()` macro
# - **Example**: `#[test] fn test_conversion() { assert_eq!(celsius_to_fahrenheit(0.0), 32.0); }`
# - **Note**: Testing is a first-class citizen in Rust
# 
# **Common Patterns Across All Languages**
# 
# No matter what language you use, look for these features:
# 
# 1. **Assertion functions**: Check expected vs. actual values
# 2. **Test organization**: Group related tests together
# 3. **Test discovery**: Automatic finding and running of tests
# 4. **Setup/teardown**: Code that runs before/after tests
# 5. **Mocking**: Replace real objects with test doubles
# 6. **Coverage tools**: Measure which code is tested
# 7. **CI integration**: Run tests automatically in pipelines
# 
# **Key Takeaway**: The language changes, but **the principles remain the same**:
# - Write tests for your code
# - Test edge cases and scientific correctness
# - Run tests frequently
# - Automate testing in CI
# 
# Don't let an unfamiliar language stop you from testing. Every language has tools—find them, learn them, use them!

# 
# While inspired by real research software failures, the specific "temperature conversion disaster" story
# is a composite fictional narrative created for pedagogical purposes. All code examples and tests
# were developed specifically for this lecture to illustrate testing concepts in research contexts.

# ### Next Steps
# 
# In **Lecture 6**, we'll learn how to:
# - Automate testing with Continuous Integration (CI)
# - Use GitHub Actions to run tests automatically
# - Set up testing workflows in GitLab
# - Build reproducible analysis pipelines
# - Ensure every code change is tested before merging
# 
# ### Remember the Cautionary Tale
# 
# The climate research team's disaster could have been prevented with:
# - A single test comparing to known conversion values
# - 5 minutes writing tests vs. 6 months dealing with retraction
# - Test coverage showing untested functions
# - Peer review of both code AND tests
# 
# **Don't let your research become a cautionary tale - test your code!**

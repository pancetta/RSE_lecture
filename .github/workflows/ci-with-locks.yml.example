# Optional: Enhanced CI with Lock Files
#
# This is an alternative CI configuration that uses conda lock files
# for more reproducible builds. To use it:
# 1. Generate lock files: make create-locks
# 2. Commit the lock files to the repository
# 3. Rename this file to ci-with-locks.yml.example
# 4. When ready to switch, replace ci.yml with this file

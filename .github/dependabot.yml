# Dependabot configuration for tracking dependencies
# This ensures we always have a running version by automatically checking for updates
# and creating PRs to update dependencies in a controlled manner.
#
# NOTE: Dependabot does not natively support conda environment.yml files.
# This configuration only tracks GitHub Actions workflows.
# Python/conda dependencies are monitored via the weekly dependency-check.yml workflow,
# which creates issues for manual review and updating.

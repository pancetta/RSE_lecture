# Dependabot configuration for tracking dependencies
# This ensures we always have a running version by automatically checking for updates
# and creating PRs to update dependencies in a controlled manner.
#
# NOTE: Dependabot does not natively support conda environment.yml files.
# This configuration only tracks GitHub Actions workflows.
# Python/conda dependencies are automatically tested and updated via the 
# automated-dependency-updates.yml workflow, which:
# 1. Checks for new versions weekly
# 2. Tests them with the full CI suite
# 3. Creates PRs when tests pass
# 4. Creates issues when tests fail (add problematic versions to ignore list below)

# Dependabot configuration for tracking dependencies
# This ensures we always have a running version by automatically checking for updates
# and creating PRs to update dependencies in a controlled manner.
#
# NOTE: Dependabot does not natively support conda environment.yml files.
# This configuration tracks:
# 1. GitHub Actions workflows (native support)
# 2. Python dependencies via requirements.txt files (pip ecosystem)
#    - requirements.txt files mirror the environment.yml dependencies
#    - Use 'make sync-requirements' to update requirements.txt from environment.yml
#    - Both file formats are maintained in the repository

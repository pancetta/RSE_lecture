# ## Part 1: The Art of Debugging
# 
# ### A New Research Challenge
# 
# Dr. Martinez is analyzing climate model output containing millions of temperature readings.
# Her analysis script runs successfully on test data, but crashes mysteriously when processing
# the full dataset. The error message is cryptic, and the bug only appears after 30 minutes
# of computation. Print statements aren't helping - there are too many to track.
# 
# She needs systematic debugging tools.
# 
# ### What is Debugging?
# 
# **Debugging** is the process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in software. Unlike testing,
# which verifies that code works correctly, debugging helps you understand **why** code fails
# and **how** to fix it.
# 
# **Common debugging approaches (from least to most effective):**
# 
# 1. **Hope and pray** - Run the code again, maybe it'll work 🤞 (Don't do this!)
# 2. **Print debugging** - Add `print()` statements everywhere
# 3. **Binary search** - Comment out half the code to locate the problem
# 4. **Rubber duck debugging** - Explain the code to an inanimate object
# 5. **Interactive debugging** - Use a debugger to step through code ⭐
# 6. **Logging** - Structured output that persists across runs ⭐
# 
# Today we focus on interactive debugging and logging - the professional approaches.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 2: The Scientific Method for Debugging
# 
# ### Systematic Debugging Process
# 
# Debugging is like scientific investigation. Follow these steps:
# 
# **1. Reproduce the bug**
# - Can you make it happen reliably?
# - What are the minimal steps to trigger it?
# - Does it happen with smaller data?
# 
# **2. Isolate the problem**
# - Which function or module causes it?
# - What input triggers it?
# - When does the state become invalid?
# 
# **3. Form a hypothesis**
# - What do you think is wrong?
# - What evidence supports this?
# - How can you test it?
# 
# **4. Test your hypothesis**
# - Use the debugger to check your assumptions
# - Add assertions to verify state
# - Try a fix in isolation
# 
# **5. Fix and verify**
# - Implement the fix
# - Write a test to prevent regression
# - Verify the bug is actually fixed
# 
# Let's see this process in action.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 3: Introduction to Python's Debugger (pdb)
# 
# ### What is pdb?
# 
# **pdb** (Python Debugger) is Python's built-in interactive debugger. It lets you:
# - Pause execution at any point
# - Inspect variable values
# - Step through code line by line
# - Execute Python commands in the current context
# - Set conditional breakpoints
# 
# **Think of it as:**
# - A microscope for your code
# - A time machine (step forward/backward)
# - An X-ray machine (see inside running code)
# 
# ### A Buggy Research Function
# 
# Let's create a function that analyzes temperature anomalies but has a subtle bug:

# %%
def calculate_anomalies(temperatures, baseline):
    """
    Calculate temperature anomalies relative to a baseline.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    temperatures : list
        Temperature readings in Celsius
    baseline : float
        Baseline temperature for comparison
        
    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Statistics about the anomalies
    """
    anomalies = []
    
    for temp in temperatures:
        anomaly = temp - baseline
        anomalies.append(anomaly)
    
    # Calculate statistics
    mean_anomaly = sum(anomalies) / len(anomalies)
    max_anomaly = max(anomalies)
    min_anomaly = min(anomalies)
    
    # BUG: This calculation is wrong when there are negative anomalies
    anomaly_range = max_anomaly - min_anomaly
    positive_anomalies = [a for a in anomalies if a > 0]
    fraction_positive = len(positive_anomalies) / len(anomalies)
    
    return {
        'mean': mean_anomaly,
        'max': max_anomaly,
        'min': min_anomaly,
        'range': anomaly_range,
        'positive_fraction': fraction_positive
    }


# Test with sample data
temps = [15.2, 16.8, 14.5, 17.3, 15.9, 16.1]
baseline_temp = 16.0

result = calculate_anomalies(temps, baseline_temp)
print("Temperature Anomaly Analysis:")
print(f"  Mean anomaly: {result['mean']:.2f}°C")
print(f"  Range: {result['range']:.2f}°C")
print(f"  Fraction above baseline: {result['positive_fraction']:.1%}")

# %% [markdown]
# The code runs without errors, but let's verify the results are correct.
# 
# **Manual verification:**
# - Temperatures: [15.2, 16.8, 14.5, 17.3, 15.9, 16.1]
# - Baseline: 16.0
# - Anomalies: [-0.8, 0.8, -1.5, 1.3, -0.1, 0.1]
# - Mean: (-0.8 + 0.8 - 1.5 + 1.3 - 0.1 + 0.1) / 6 = -0.2 / 6 ≈ -0.033°C ✓
# - Min: -1.5, Max: 1.3, Range: 2.8°C ✓
# - Positive: [0.8, 1.3, 0.1] = 3 out of 6 = 50% ✓
# 
# The function actually works correctly! But what if we had a more complex case?

# %% [markdown]
# ### Using pdb Interactively
# 
# There are several ways to start the debugger:
# 
# **Method 1: Insert a breakpoint in code**
# ```python
# import pdb
# 
# def my_function(data):
#     result = process(data)
#     pdb.set_trace()  # Execution will pause here
#     return result
# ```
# 
# **Method 2: Python 3.7+ breakpoint() function**
# ```python
# def my_function(data):
#     result = process(data)
#     breakpoint()  # Modern way - same as pdb.set_trace()
#     return result
# ```
# 
# **Method 3: Post-mortem debugging (after a crash)**
# ```python
# import pdb
# 
# try:
#     buggy_function()
# except:
#     pdb.post_mortem()  # Start debugger at the crash point
# ```
# 
# **Method 4: Run script under debugger**
# ```bash
# python -m pdb my_script.py
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# ### Common pdb Commands
# 
# Once in the debugger, you can use these commands:
# 
# **Navigation:**
# - `n` (next) - Execute the current line and move to the next
# - `s` (step) - Step into a function call
# - `r` (return) - Continue until the current function returns
# - `c` (continue) - Continue execution until next breakpoint
# - `l` (list) - Show source code around current line
# - `ll` (longlist) - Show source code for entire function
# 
# **Inspection:**
# - `p variable` - Print value of a variable
# - `pp variable` - Pretty-print value of a variable
# - `type(variable)` - Check variable type
# - `dir()` - List all variables in current scope
# - `args` - Print arguments of current function
# 
# **Breakpoints:**
# - `b line_number` - Set breakpoint at line
# - `b function_name` - Set breakpoint at function
# - `b` - List all breakpoints
# - `cl` - Clear all breakpoints
# 
# **Execution:**
# - `q` (quit) - Exit the debugger
# - `h` (help) - Show help message
# - `h command` - Help for specific command

# %% [markdown]
# ### Debugging Example: Finding a Subtle Bug
# 
# Let's examine a more complex case where pdb would be invaluable.
# This function processes climate model data, but has a bug that only appears
# with certain input patterns:

# %%
def analyze_temperature_trends(daily_temps, window_size=7):
    """
    Analyze temperature trends using a moving average.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    daily_temps : list
        Daily temperature readings
    window_size : int
        Number of days for moving average
        
    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Trend analysis results
    """
    if len(daily_temps) < window_size:
        raise ValueError(f"Need at least {window_size} days of data")
    
    # Calculate moving averages
    moving_averages = []
    for i in range(len(daily_temps) - window_size + 1):
        window = daily_temps[i:i + window_size]
        avg = sum(window) / window_size
        moving_averages.append(avg)
    
    # Calculate trend (slope of moving averages)
    # BUG: This fails when moving_averages has only 1 element
    n = len(moving_averages)
    if n < 2:
        return {'trend': 0.0, 'moving_avg': moving_averages[0]}
    
    # Simple linear regression slope
    x_mean = (n - 1) / 2.0
    y_mean = sum(moving_averages) / n
    
    numerator = sum((i - x_mean) * (y - y_mean) 
                    for i, y in enumerate(moving_averages))
    denominator = sum((i - x_mean) ** 2 for i in range(n))
    
    trend = numerator / denominator if denominator != 0 else 0.0
    
    return {
        'trend': trend,
        'moving_avg_start': moving_averages[0],
        'moving_avg_end': moving_averages[-1],
        'data_points': n
    }


# Test with different datasets
print("Case 1: Normal dataset (30 days)")
temps_normal = [20 + i * 0.1 for i in range(30)]
result1 = analyze_temperature_trends(temps_normal, window_size=7)
print(f"  Trend: {result1['trend']:.4f}°C/day")

print("\nCase 2: Minimal dataset (exactly window_size)")
temps_minimal = [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]
result2 = analyze_temperature_trends(temps_minimal, window_size=7)
print(f"  Trend: {result2['trend']:.4f}°C/day")

print("\nCase 3: Just above minimal (window_size + 1)")
temps_edge = [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]
result3 = analyze_temperature_trends(temps_edge, window_size=7)
print(f"  Trend: {result3['trend']:.4f}°C/day")

# ### How pdb Would Help Debug This
# 
# If this function had a bug (which it doesn't in this version), here's how you'd debug it:
# 
# **Debugging session (conceptual):**
# ```python
# # Add breakpoint before the suspicious calculation
# def analyze_temperature_trends(daily_temps, window_size=7):
#     # ... earlier code ...
#     
#     breakpoint()  # Pause here
#     
#     # Calculate trend
#     n = len(moving_averages)
#     # ...
# ```
# 
# **In the debugger:**
# ```
# (Pdb) p moving_averages
# [23.0]  # Only one element!
# 
# (Pdb) p len(moving_averages)
# 1
# 
# (Pdb) p window_size
# 7
# 
# (Pdb) p len(daily_temps)
# 7  # Exactly equal to window_size
# 
# (Pdb) # Aha! When len(daily_temps) == window_size, we get only 1 moving average
# (Pdb) # That's why n < 2, so we return early - working as designed!
# ```
# 
# **Key insight from debugging:**
# - pdb lets you inspect the actual data values
# - You can see exactly what state your program is in
# - You can test hypotheses interactively
# - You can execute code to see what would happen

#         <li><strong>Debug a real bug:</strong> Intentionally introduce a subtle bug in

# ## Part 4: Logging for Research Software
# 
# ### Why Logging Beats Print Statements
# 
# **Problems with print() debugging:**
# - Output mixed with legitimate program output
# - Hard to turn on/off selectively
# - No timestamp or context
# - Lost when program finishes
# - Not suitable for production code
# - Can't filter by importance
# 
# **Advantages of proper logging:**
# - Separate log files from output
# - Different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
# - Timestamps and context automatically
# - Can log to multiple destinations
# - Enable/disable without code changes
# - Production-ready
# - Can filter and search logs
# 
# ### Python's logging Module
# 
# Python's built-in `logging` module provides professional logging capabilities:

# %%
import logging

# Configure logging (do this once at program start)
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,  # Set minimum level to log
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
)

# Create a logger for this module
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Demonstrate different log levels
logger.debug("This is a DEBUG message - very detailed info")
logger.info("This is an INFO message - general information")
logger.warning("This is a WARNING message - something unexpected")
logger.error("This is an ERROR message - something failed")
logger.critical("This is a CRITICAL message - serious problem")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Log Levels Explained
# 
# **DEBUG (10)**: Detailed diagnostic information
# - Variable values, loop iterations, intermediate calculations
# - Only needed when diagnosing problems
# - Example: "Processing data point 1523 of 10000"
# 
# **INFO (20)**: General informational messages
# - Confirm things are working as expected
# - Major steps in processing
# - Example: "Starting temperature analysis for dataset: arctic_2023"
# 
# **WARNING (30)**: Warning about potential issues
# - Something unexpected but not fatal
# - Deprecated features, missing optional data
# - Example: "Missing metadata for 5 stations, using defaults"
# 
# **ERROR (40)**: Error occurred, but program continues
# - Part of processing failed
# - Example: "Failed to process file data_corrupt.csv: invalid format"
# 
# **CRITICAL (50)**: Serious error, program may crash
# - Fatal errors
# - Example: "Out of memory, cannot continue analysis"
# 
# **Key principle:** Only messages at or above the configured level are shown.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Logging in Research Code - Practical Example
# 
# Let's add proper logging to our temperature analysis function:

# %%
import logging

# Configure logger for this example
logger = logging.getLogger('climate_analysis')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Create console handler with formatting
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
console_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
                              datefmt='%H:%M:%S')
console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(console_handler)

    if len(valid_stations) == 0:
        logger.critical("No valid stations remaining! Cannot proceed with analysis.")
        raise ValueError("No valid data available for analysis")
    
    return {

# %% [markdown]
# ### Best Practices for Logging in Research
# 
# **1. Log at the right level**
# - Use INFO for major milestones: "Started processing", "Completed analysis"
# - Use DEBUG for detailed tracking: variable values, iterations
# - Use WARNING for unexpected but handled situations: missing optional data
# - Use ERROR for failures that don't stop execution: one file failed
# - Use CRITICAL for fatal errors: out of memory, all data invalid
# 
# **2. Include context**
# ```python
# logger.info(f"Processing dataset: {dataset_name}, {len(data)} records")
# ```
# 
# **3. Log to files for long-running analyses**
# ```python
# file_handler = logging.FileHandler('analysis.log')
# logger.addHandler(file_handler)
# ```
# 
# **4. Don't log sensitive data**
# ```python
# # BAD
# logger.info(f"User password: {password}")
# 
# # GOOD
# logger.info(f"User authenticated: {username}")
# ```
# 
# **5. Use meaningful messages**
# ```python
# # BAD
# logger.info("Done")
# 
# # GOOD
# logger.info("Temperature analysis complete: 10000 records processed in 2.5s")
# ```
# 
# **6. Balance verbosity**
# - Too little logging: can't diagnose problems
# - Too much logging: drowning in noise, slow performance
# - Find the sweet spot for your use case

#     <p>Strategic logging transforms debugging from guesswork to science!</p>
#     <ul>
#         <li><strong>Build a comprehensive logging strategy:</strong> Add structured
#         logging to a research pipeline with DEBUG for detailed flow, INFO for progress,

# ## Part 5: Performance Profiling
# 
# ### Dr. Martinez's Performance Problem
# 
# Remember Dr. Martinez from the beginning? Her code now runs without crashing,
# but it's *slow*. Processing a full year of climate data takes 6 hours.
# She needs to run it for 50 years of data - that's 12.5 days!
# 
# Before optimizing, she needs to know: **Where is the time being spent?**
# 
# ### The Golden Rule of Optimization
# 
# **"Premature optimization is the root of all evil."** - Donald Knuth
# 
# **Why this matters:**
# 1. **You'll probably guess wrong** where the bottleneck is
# 2. **Optimization makes code complex** - harder to read and maintain
# 3. **Development time is expensive** - don't waste it on wrong targets
# 4. **Correctness first** - broken fast code is still broken
# 
# **The right approach:**
# 1. Write clear, correct code first
# 2. Test it thoroughly
# 3. Profile to find actual bottlenecks
# 4. Optimize only the slow parts
# 5. Verify optimization didn't break correctness
# 6. Measure improvement
# 
# ### What is Profiling?
# 
# **Profiling** measures where your program spends time and resources.
# 
# **Types of profiling:**
# - **Time profiling**: Which functions take the most time?
# - **Line profiling**: Which specific lines are slow?
# - **Memory profiling**: Which code uses the most memory?
# - **Call profiling**: How many times is each function called?

# ## Part 6: Time Profiling with cProfile
# 
# ### Python's Built-in Profiler: cProfile
# 
# **cProfile** is Python's built-in deterministic profiler. It measures:
# - How many times each function is called
# - How much time each function takes
# - Where time is spent in your program
# 
# **Two ways to use cProfile:**

# %% [markdown]
# ### Method 1: Profile from Command Line
# 
# ```bash
# python -m cProfile -o profile_output.prof my_script.py
# ```
# 
# This saves profiling data to a file for later analysis.
# 
# **View the results:**
# ```python
# import pstats
# 
# stats = pstats.Stats('profile_output.prof')
# stats.strip_dirs()
# stats.sort_stats('cumulative')
# stats.print_stats(10)  # Show top 10 functions
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# ### Method 2: Profile Specific Code
# 
# Profile just the code you care about:

# %%
import cProfile
import pstats
from io import StringIO


def slow_temperature_analysis(temperatures):
    """
    Analyze temperature data (intentionally inefficient version).
    
    This demonstrates common performance issues in research code.

    results = {}
    
    # Inefficient: Recalculating mean multiple times
    def calculate_mean(temps):
        return sum(temps) / len(temps) if temps else 0
    
    # Calculate mean anomalies (inefficient)
    mean_temp = calculate_mean(temperatures)
    anomalies = []
    for temp in temperatures:
        anomaly = temp - mean_temp
        anomalies.append(anomaly)
    
    # Find extreme values (inefficient - recalculating)
    results['mean'] = calculate_mean(temperatures)
    results['max'] = max(temperatures)
    results['min'] = min(temperatures)
    
    # Calculate percentiles (very inefficient)
    sorted_temps = sorted(temperatures)
    n = len(sorted_temps)
    results['p25'] = sorted_temps[n // 4]
    results['p50'] = sorted_temps[n // 2]
    results['p75'] = sorted_temps[3 * n // 4]
    
    # Count days above/below mean (inefficient)
    above_mean = sum(1 for t in temperatures if t > results['mean'])
    results['days_above_mean'] = above_mean
    
    return results


# Create realistic dataset
import random
random.seed(42)
large_dataset = [20 + random.gauss(0, 5) for _ in range(10000)]

# Profile the function
profiler = cProfile.Profile()
profiler.enable()

result = slow_temperature_analysis(large_dataset)

profiler.disable()

# Print profiling results
s = StringIO()
ps = pstats.Stats(profiler, stream=s).sort_stats('cumulative')
ps.print_stats(10)
print(s.getvalue())

# %% [markdown]
# ### Understanding cProfile Output
# 
# The output shows columns:
# 
# - **ncalls**: Number of times the function was called
# - **tottime**: Total time in function (excluding subcalls)
# - **percall**: tottime / ncalls
# - **cumtime**: Total time including subcalls
# - **percall**: cumtime / ncalls
# - **filename:lineno(function)**: Where the function is defined
# 
# **What to look for:**
# 1. Functions with high `cumtime` - these are the bottlenecks
# 2. Functions called many times - optimization candidates
# 3. Surprising slow functions - investigate why
# 
# **In our example:**
# - The `sorted()` calls are expensive
# - We're recalculating things multiple times
# - List comprehensions are faster than loops with append

# %% [markdown]
# ### Optimized Version
# 
# Based on profiling, here's an optimized version:

# %%
def fast_temperature_analysis(temperatures):
    """

# ## Part 7: Line-by-Line Profiling
# 
# ### When You Need More Detail
# 
# Sometimes function-level profiling isn't enough. You need to know
# which *specific lines* within a function are slow.
# 
# **line_profiler** provides line-by-line timing information.
# 
# ### Using line_profiler
# 
# **Installation:**
# ```bash
# pip install line_profiler
# ```
# 
# **Usage:**
# ```python
# from line_profiler import LineProfiler
# 
# def my_function():
#     # ... code ...
#     pass
# 
# profiler = LineProfiler()
# profiler.add_function(my_function)
# profiler.enable()
# 
# my_function()  # Run the function
# 
# profiler.disable()
# profiler.print_stats()
# ```
# 
# **Output shows:**
# - Time per line
# - Percentage of total time
# - Number of hits (how many times executed)
# 
# **Example output (conceptual):**
# ```
# Line #      Hits         Time  Per Hit   % Time  Line Contents
# ==============================================================
#      5         1        100.0    100.0      1.0      for i in range(1000):
#      6      1000       5000.0      5.0     50.0          result += expensive_call()
#      7      1000       4900.0      4.9     49.0          other_work()
# ```
# 
# **Interpretation:**
# Line 6 takes 50% of the time - that's where to optimize!

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 8: Memory Profiling
# 
# ### When Memory is the Bottleneck
# 
# Sometimes the problem isn't speed but memory usage. Research data can be huge!
# 
# **memory_profiler** tracks memory usage line-by-line.
# 
# **Installation:**
# ```bash
# pip install memory_profiler
# ```
# 
# **Usage:**
# ```python
# from memory_profiler import profile
# 
# @profile  # Decorator to mark function for profiling
# def memory_intensive_function():
#     large_list = [i for i in range(10000000)]
#     large_dict = {i: i**2 for i in range(1000000)}
#     return len(large_list) + len(large_dict)
# 
# # Run your script with:
# # python -m memory_profiler my_script.py
# ```
# 
# **Output shows:**
# - Memory usage before each line
# - Memory increment for each line
# - Identifies memory leaks and large allocations
# 
# ### Memory Optimization Strategies
# 
# **1. Use generators instead of lists**
# ```python
# # BAD: Loads entire dataset into memory
# data = [process(line) for line in huge_file]
# 
# # GOOD: Processes one item at a time
# data = (process(line) for line in huge_file)
# ```
# 
# **2. Use appropriate data structures**
# ```python
# # If you need numerical arrays, use NumPy
# import numpy as np
# array = np.array([1, 2, 3])  # Much more memory-efficient than list
# ```
# 
# **3. Delete large objects when done**
# ```python
# large_data = load_huge_dataset()
# process(large_data)
# del large_data  # Free memory immediately
# ```
# 
# **4. Use chunking for large files**
# ```python
# # Process file in chunks instead of loading all at once
# for chunk in pd.read_csv('huge_file.csv', chunksize=10000):
#     process(chunk)
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 9: Practical Profiling Example
# 
# ### Real-World Climate Data Processing
# 
# Let's put it all together with a realistic example:

# %%

                correlations.append((stations[i], stations[j], corr))
    
    return correlations

# ### Profiling Reveals the Problem
# 
# If we profiled this code with cProfile, we'd see:
# 
# **Key findings:**
# - The nested loops create O(n²) complexity
# - For 100 stations: 4,950 pairs to compare
# - For 1,000 stations: 499,500 pairs to compare! 
# - We're recalculating means and variances repeatedly
# - NumPy would be 100x faster for these operations
# 
# **Optimization strategy based on profiling:**
# 1. Calculate statistics (mean, variance) once per station
# 2. Use NumPy for vectorized operations
# 3. Only calculate correlations for nearby stations
# 4. Parallelize if still too slow
#

# ### Lessons from Profiling
# 
# **What profiling taught us:**
# 
# 1. **Measure, don't guess** - The bottleneck might surprise you
# 2. **Algorithm matters** - O(n²) vs O(n) is huge for large n
# 3. **Pre-compute when possible** - Don't recalculate the same values
# 4. **Know your data** - Geographic locality lets us skip comparisons
# 5. **Use the right tools** - NumPy would make this even faster
# 
# **General optimization principles for research code:**
# 
# - **Correctness first**: Broken fast code is useless
# - **Profile before optimizing**: Find the real bottlenecks
# - **Start with algorithms**: Better algorithm > micro-optimization
# - **Use libraries**: NumPy, pandas, etc. are highly optimized
# - **Optimize the hot path**: 90% of time is in 10% of code
# - **Measure improvements**: Verify optimization actually helps
# - **Balance speed and clarity**: Readable code is maintainable code

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 10: Practical Debugging and Profiling Workflow
# 
# ### Recommended Workflow for Research Software
# 
# **Phase 1: Development**
# 1. Write clear, simple code
# 2. Add assertions for assumptions
# 3. Use descriptive variable names
# 4. Write docstrings
# 5. Add logging at key points
# 
# **Phase 2: Testing**
# 1. Write unit tests (Lecture 5)
# 2. Test edge cases
# 3. Use debugger to understand failures
# 4. Achieve good test coverage
# 
# **Phase 3: Debugging**
# 1. Reproduce the bug reliably
# 2. Check logs for clues
# 3. Use debugger to inspect state
# 4. Form hypothesis, test it
# 5. Fix and add regression test
# 
# **Phase 4: Optimization (only if needed)**
# 1. Profile to find bottlenecks
# 2. Optimize hot paths only
# 3. Verify correctness after optimization
# 4. Measure actual improvement
# 5. Update documentation
# 
# ### Tools Summary
# 
# **Debugging:**
# - `pdb` / `breakpoint()` - Interactive debugging
# - `logging` - Structured output for diagnosis
# - `assert` statements - Catch invalid state early
# 
# **Profiling:**
# - `cProfile` - Function-level time profiling
# - `line_profiler` - Line-by-line time profiling
# - `memory_profiler` - Memory usage profiling
# - `timeit` - Micro-benchmarking for small code snippets
# 
# **When to use each:**
# - **pdb**: When code behaves unexpectedly, crashes, or produces wrong results
# - **logging**: Always - it's good practice for any serious code
# - **cProfile**: When code is too slow, to find bottlenecks
# - **line_profiler**: When you know which function is slow but not which line
# - **memory_profiler**: When you run out of memory or suspect memory leaks

# ### Technical Debt and Refactoring Decisions
# 
# Now that we've learned about profiling and optimization, let's discuss an important question: 
# **When should you refactor code vs. when should you rewrite it?** This is a critical decision 
# in research software development, especially when profiling reveals performance issues or when 
# debugging exposes design problems.
# 
# #### What is Technical Debt?
# 
# **Technical debt** is a metaphor coined by Ward Cunningham. It's the cost of choosing a quick 
# solution now that will require more work later. Like financial debt, it accumulates "interest" - 
# the longer you wait to address it, the harder and more expensive it becomes.
# 
# **Examples in research code:**
# - Copy-pasting code instead of creating functions (violates DRY)
# - Hardcoding values instead of using configuration
# - Skipping tests "just this once"
# - Writing unclear code because "I'll clean it up later"
# - Using inefficient algorithms because "it works for now"
# 
# **Why debt accumulates**: Research projects evolve. What started as a 100-line script for one 
# experiment becomes a 10,000-line analysis pipeline used by your whole lab. The quick hacks you 
# made in week 1 now slow down everyone in year 2.
# 
# **Profiling reveals debt**: When profiling shows that your code is slow, it's often because of 
# technical debt—inefficient algorithms, duplicated work, poor data structures. The question is: 
# fix the debt (refactor) or start over (rewrite)?
# 
# #### Refactor or Rewrite? A Decision Framework
# 
# **Refactoring**: Improving code structure without changing behavior. Small, incremental changes.
# 
# **Rewriting**: Throwing away code and starting fresh. Big, risky changes.
# 
# **When to REFACTOR** (most cases):
# 
# ✅ Code works but is hard to understand or maintain  
# ✅ You have tests that verify correctness  
# ✅ Problems are localized to specific functions/modules  
# ✅ You want to preserve git history and attribution  
# ✅ Team is actively using the code  
# ✅ Changes can be made incrementally  
# 
# **When to REWRITE** (rare):
# 
# ⚠️ Fundamental architectural problems throughout  
# ⚠️ Technology stack is obsolete (Python 2 → Python 3)  
# ⚠️ Requirements changed completely  
# ⚠️ Code is a prototype, never meant for production  
# ⚠️ No tests exist and code is too complex to test  
# ⚠️ Rewrite would be faster than fixing  
# 
# **Default choice: REFACTOR**. Rewrites are risky, often fail, and lose accumulated knowledge.
# 
# #### Decision Matrix: Size × Risk × Time
# 
# | Code Size | Test Coverage | Risk | Recommendation |
# |-----------|---------------|------|----------------|
# | < 100 lines | None | Low | Rewrite OK if you want |
# | < 1000 lines | Good tests | Low | Refactor incrementally |
# | > 1000 lines | Good tests | Medium | Definitely refactor |
# | > 1000 lines | No tests | High | Write tests first, then refactor |
# | > 10000 lines | Any | Very High | Never rewrite everything at once |
# 
# **The "Strangler Fig" pattern**: For large rewrites, create new code alongside old code, 
# gradually replacing pieces until nothing of the old remains. Named after the fig tree that 
# grows around and eventually replaces its host tree.
# 
# #### Profiling-Driven Refactoring: A Case Study
# 
# Let's apply this to our climate analysis example. Profiling revealed the bottleneck:

        # Only check stations within MAX_DISTANCE in longitude
        for j, station_j in sorted_stations[idx + 1:]:
            if abs(station_i['lon'] - station_j['lon']) > MAX_DISTANCE_DEGREES:
                break  # No need to check further
            
            distance = calculate_distance(station_i, station_j)
            if distance < MAX_DISTANCE_DEGREES:
                results.append((i, j))
    
    return results

# Test: Still works? ✓
# Performance: Much faster! (early termination)

# %% [markdown]
# **What we accomplished through refactoring:**
# 
# 1. ✅ **Improved clarity** (named constant instead of magic number)
# 2. ✅ **Improved testability** (extracted distance function)
# 3. ✅ **Improved performance** (better algorithm)
# 4. ✅ **Preserved correctness** (tests passed at each step)
# 5. ✅ **Kept git history** (incremental commits show evolution)
# 
# **Why refactoring worked here:**
# - Small, focused changes
# - Tests verified each step
# - Each version was an improvement
# - Never broke working code
# 
# **Compare to rewriting**: If we'd thrown away the code and started over, we might have:
# - Introduced new bugs
# - Lost edge case handling
# - Broken dependent code
# - Wasted time reimplementing working parts
# 
# #### Incremental Refactoring Strategy
# 
# **The boy scout rule**: "Leave code cleaner than you found it."
# 
# When you touch code (for any reason), make it slightly better:
# 
# 1. **Adding a feature?** → Clean up surrounding code first
# 2. **Fixing a bug?** → Refactor to prevent similar bugs
# 3. **Profiling reveals slowness?** → Extract the slow part, optimize it
# 4. **Code review feedback?** → Apply the lesson throughout the codebase
# 
# **Small refactorings compound**: Five minutes of cleanup per day = cleaner codebase in weeks.
# 
# **Safe refactoring practices:**
# - Always have tests before refactoring
# - Make one change at a time
# - Run tests after each change
# - Commit working changes frequently
# - Use version control (easy to revert if needed)
# - Don't change behavior and refactor simultaneously
# 
# #### When Technical Debt is Acceptable
# 
# **Controversial opinion**: Some technical debt is okay, even good!
# 
# **Accept debt when:**
# - Prototyping to test research ideas
# - Rapid iteration is more important than quality
# - Code will be thrown away after the experiment
# - You're learning and will rewrite with knowledge gained
# - Deadline is critical (conference submission!)
# 
# **But**: Make it intentional. Write a comment: `# TODO: This is hacky, clean up later`
# 
# **Pay debt before:**
# - Publishing the code
# - Sharing with collaborators
# - Using in production analysis
# - Building upon it for future work
# 
# **Research reality**: Your "quick prototype" often becomes the production code your entire 
# paper depends on. Plan accordingly!
# 
# #### Key Takeaways: Refactoring Mindset
# 
# 1. **Technical debt is inevitable** - research code evolves, requirements change
# 2. **Default to refactoring** - rewrites are risky and often fail
# 3. **Profiling guides refactoring** - focus on actual bottlenecks, not guesses
# 4. **Small steps, tested** - incremental changes with tests are safe
# 5. **Don't rewrite working code** - unless you have a really good reason
# 6. **Tests enable refactoring** - you can't refactor safely without tests
# 
# **Connection to earlier lectures:**
# - **Lecture 4**: Good design principles prevent technical debt
# - **Lecture 5**: Tests make refactoring safe
# - **Today**: Profiling reveals where to refactor for performance

# ## Part 11: Debugging Tips for Research Software
# 
# ### Common Research Software Bugs
# 
# **1. Off-by-one errors in loops**
# ```python
# # BAD: Misses last element
# for i in range(len(data) - 1):
#     process(data[i])
# 
# # Use debugger to check: are all elements processed?
# ```
# 
# **2. Floating-point comparison**
# ```python
# # BAD: Rarely true due to floating-point precision
# if calculated_value == 0.3:
#     ...
# 
# # GOOD: Use tolerance
# if abs(calculated_value - 0.3) < 1e-10:
#     ...
# ```
# 
# **3. Mutable default arguments**
# ```python
# # BAD: Default list is shared between calls!
# def add_measurement(value, measurements=[]):
#     measurements.append(value)
#     return measurements
# 
# # GOOD: Use None and create new list
# def add_measurement(value, measurements=None):
#     if measurements is None:
#         measurements = []
#     measurements.append(value)
#     return measurements
# ```
# 
# **4. Index errors with slicing**
# ```python
# # Check bounds before slicing
# data[start:end]  # What if start >= len(data)?
# 
# # Use debugger to check: p start, p end, p len(data)
# ```
# 
# **5. Division by zero in calculations**
# ```python
# # Common in normalizations
# normalized = (value - mean) / std_dev  # What if std_dev == 0?
# 
# # Add assertion or check
# assert std_dev != 0, f"Standard deviation is zero for {data}"
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# ### Debugging Strategies
# 
# **1. Simplify inputs**
# - Use smaller datasets
# - Use simpler test cases
# - Isolate the failing component
# 
# **2. Binary search for bugs**
# - Comment out half the code
# - Which half has the bug?
# - Repeat until found
# 
# **3. Add assertions liberally**
# ```python
# def process_temperature(temp_celsius):
#     assert -100 <= temp_celsius <= 100, f"Unrealistic temperature: {temp_celsius}"
#     # ... process ...
# ```
# 
# **4. Use print() strategically**
# - Print at entry/exit of functions
# - Print loop iterations
# - Print variable types and shapes
# - Remove prints and add logging later
# 
# **5. Compare with known good results**
# - Test against validated outputs
# - Use simple cases where you can calculate by hand
# - Compare with other implementations

# %% [markdown]
# ## Summary
# 
# ### Key Takeaways
# 
# **Debugging:**
# 1. Use systematic approaches, not random changes
# 2. Learn to use pdb - it's more powerful than print statements
# 3. Add logging to research code from the start
# 4. Use appropriate log levels for different situations
# 5. Write tests to prevent bugs from recurring
# 
# **Profiling:**
# 1. Don't optimize prematurely - profile first
# 2. Use cProfile to find slow functions
# 3. Use line_profiler for detailed line-by-line analysis
# 4. Optimize algorithms before micro-optimizations
# 5. Measure improvements to verify optimization worked
# 
# **Best Practices:**
# 1. Write correct code first, optimize later
# 2. Add logging and assertions during development
# 3. Use debugger to understand code behavior
# 4. Profile before optimizing
# 5. Balance speed, correctness, and readability
# 
# ### The Complete Research Software Workflow
# 
# 1. **Design**: Plan your approach
# 2. **Implement**: Write clear, tested code (Lectures 1-5)
# 3. **Automate**: Set up CI/CD (Lecture 6)
# 4. **Debug**: Fix issues systematically (Lecture 7 - today!)
# 5. **Optimize**: Make it fast where needed (Lecture 7 - today!)
# 6. **Document**: Explain what and why
# 7. **Share**: Publish your research software
# 
# **Remember:** Research software should be:
# - **Correct**: Produces right results
# - **Testable**: Has comprehensive tests
# - **Maintainable**: Can be understood and modified
# - **Efficient**: Fast enough for its purpose
# - **Reproducible**: Others can verify results

# ## Debugging and Profiling in Other Languages
# 
# While this lecture focused on Python, the principles apply to all programming languages.
# Here's what to look for in other common research software languages:
# 
# ### R
# 
# **Debugging:**
# - **browser()** - R's interactive debugger (similar to pdb)
# - **debug()** / **debugonce()** - Set breakpoints on functions
# - **traceback()** - Show call stack after errors
# - **print()** / **cat()** - Basic debugging (like Python print)
# 
# **Profiling:**
# - **Rprof()** - Built-in profiler for time analysis
# - **profvis** package - Visual profiling tool
# - **microbenchmark** package - Precise timing for small code snippets
# 
# **What to look for:** RStudio has excellent built-in debugging support with breakpoints and variable inspection.
# 
# ### MATLAB
# 
# **Debugging:**
# - **dbstop** - Set breakpoints in code
# - **dbstep** - Step through code line by line
# - **dbcont** - Continue execution
# - **dbquit** - Exit debugger
# - Built-in GUI debugger in MATLAB IDE
# 
# **Profiling:**
# - **profile on/off** - Start/stop profiler
# - **profile viewer** - Visual profiling results
# - **tic/toc** - Simple timing measurements
# 
# **What to look for:** MATLAB's GUI makes debugging very visual - you can
# click to set breakpoints and see variables in workspace.
# 
# ### C/C++
# 
# **Debugging:**
# - **gdb** - GNU Debugger (command-line, powerful)
# - **lldb** - LLVM debugger (macOS default)
# - **valgrind** - Memory debugging and leak detection
# - IDE debuggers (Visual Studio, CLion, Eclipse)
# 
# **Profiling:**
# - **gprof** - GNU profiler (compile with -pg flag)
# - **perf** - Linux performance analysis tools
# - **Valgrind** with **callgrind** - Call graph profiling
# - **Intel VTune** - Advanced profiling (commercial)
# 
# **What to look for:** Compiled languages need special compilation flags for
# debugging (-g) and profiling (-pg). Memory errors are common - use valgrind!
# 
# ### Julia
# 
# **Debugging:**
# - **Debugger.jl** - Interactive debugging package
# - **@enter** macro - Step into function
# - **@run** macro - Run with debugger
# - Similar commands to pdb: `n` (next), `s` (step), `c` (continue)
# 
# **Profiling:**
# - **@time** macro - Quick timing measurement
# - **@profile** macro - Statistical profiler
# - **ProfileView.jl** - Visualize profiling results
# - **BenchmarkTools.jl** - Accurate benchmarking
# 
# **What to look for:** Julia's JIT compilation means first run is slow - profile after warm-up!
# 
# ### Fortran
# 
# **Debugging:**
# - **gdb** - Works with Fortran (compile with -g)
# - **idb** - Intel Fortran debugger
# - **totalview** - Commercial parallel debugger
# - **print** statements - Still widely used
# 
# **Profiling:**
# - **gprof** - GNU profiler (compile with -pg)
# - **Intel VTune** - For Intel compilers
# - **TAU** - Performance analysis for parallel code
# - **Scalasca** - For MPI/OpenMP programs
# 
# **What to look for:** Fortran is often used for parallel computing - look for MPI/OpenMP-aware profilers.
# 
# ### Rust
# 
# **Debugging:**
# - **rust-gdb** / **rust-lldb** - GDB/LLDB wrappers for Rust
# - **println!** macro - Debug printing
# - **dbg!** macro - Quick debug output with values
# - IDE support (VSCode, IntelliJ)
# 
# **Profiling:**
# - **cargo-flamegraph** - Generate flame graphs
# - **perf** - Linux performance tools
# - **Criterion.rs** - Benchmarking library
# - **dhat** - Heap profiling
# 
# **What to look for:** Rust's ownership system catches many bugs at compile time. Focus profiling on algorithmic issues.
# 
# ### Common Patterns Across Languages
# 
# No matter what language you use, look for these tools:
# 
# 1. **Interactive debugger** - Step through code, inspect variables
# 2. **Logging framework** - Structured output with levels
# 3. **Profiler** - Time and memory analysis
# 4. **Benchmarking tools** - Accurate performance measurement
# 5. **Memory checkers** - For compiled languages (valgrind, sanitizers)
# 6. **IDE integration** - Visual debugging and profiling
# 
# **Key principle:** The concepts (systematic debugging, logging, profiling
# before optimizing) are universal - only the tools change!

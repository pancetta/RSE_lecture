#
# ## Overview
# This lecture explores how to work effectively in research software teams, from code
# reviews and pull requests to onboarding new collaborators. Research is increasingly
# collaborative, and your software needs to support multiple contributors while
# maintaining quality and reproducibility. We'll examine practical workflows for team
# collaboration, effective code review practices, and how to build a welcoming
# community around your research software.
#
# **Duration**: ~90 minutes
#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# Before starting this lecture, you should be familiar with:
# - Git branching and merging (covered in Lecture 2)
# - GitHub/GitLab basics including pull/merge requests
# - Writing and testing Python code (covered in Lectures 2-5)
# - Code review concepts from earlier lectures
#
# This lecture builds on your Git knowledge and introduces systematic collaboration practices.
#
# ## Learning Objectives
# - Understand why collaboration requires deliberate processes and practices
# - Master the pull request workflow for collaborative development
# - Conduct effective and constructive code reviews
# - Handle merge conflicts and coordinate with team members
# - Onboard new contributors to research projects
# - Apply collaboration practices across different version control platforms
# - Navigate team dynamics and communication challenges
# - Adapt collaboration practices for different programming languages

# ## Part 1: Why Collaboration Is Hard - A Research Lab Story
#
# ### The Single-Developer Comfort Zone
#
# Dr. James Park had been developing his climate simulation software for three years.
# He knew every line of code, every quirk, every optimization. His workflow was simple:
# - Write code directly on the `main` branch
# - Commit when features work
# - No code reviews (who would review?)
# - Documentation? "I know how it works"
#
# The code worked perfectly - for him.
#
# ### The Growth Phase: Adding Collaborators
#
# James's research gained attention. His lab hired:
# - **Lisa**: Postdoc expert in data analysis
# - **Raj**: PhD student working on new algorithms
# - **Maya**: Research software engineer improving performance
#
# **Week 1** - Excitement:
# ```bash
# # Everyone clones the repository
# git clone https://github.com/jpark/climate-sim.git
# # Everyone starts coding...
# ```
#
# **Week 2** - Chaos:
# - Lisa pushed code that broke Raj's simulations
# - Raj's commit overwrote Maya's performance improvements
# - Maya couldn't understand James's variable names (`tmp_x2`, `calc_v3_FINAL`)
# - James spent 15 hours fixing merge conflicts
# - Nobody knew which version of the code produced which results
#
# **Week 3** - Crisis:
# - A critical bug in the main branch delayed everyone's research
# - Nobody could identify who introduced it (no code reviews)
# - The team wasted a week tracking it down
# - Tensions rose: "Why didn't you test before pushing?"
#
# ### The Transformation
#
# The lab brought in a research software engineering consultant who introduced:
# - **Branch-based workflow**: Feature branches instead of working on `main`
# - **Pull requests**: All changes reviewed before merging
# - **Code review checklist**: Consistent quality standards
# - **Communication protocols**: Clear expectations and feedback
# - **Documentation requirements**: Every PR needs updated docs
#
# **Three months later:**
# - 5 contributors working smoothly
# - Zero conflicts on main branch
# - Bugs caught in review before merging
# - New contributors onboarded in days, not weeks
# - Improved code quality across the board
# - Published results with clear attribution
#
# **The lesson**: Good collaboration requires **process**, not just **Git**.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 2: The Pull Request Workflow
#
# ### Understanding Pull Requests
#
# A **Pull Request (PR)** (GitHub) or **Merge Request (MR)** (GitLab) is a formal
# request to merge your changes into another branch. It's not just about code - it's
# about **communication** and **collaboration**.
#
# **What a PR provides:**
# - ✅ Place for discussion about changes
# - ✅ Code review before merging
# - ✅ Automated testing (CI/CD)
# - ✅ Documentation of why changes were made
# - ✅ Clear attribution of contributions
# - ✅ Opportunity to catch problems early
#
# ### The Standard Git Workflow for Teams
#
# **Step 1: Sync with main branch**
# ```bash
# # Start with updated main
# git checkout main
# git pull origin main
# ```
#
# **Step 2: Create a feature branch**
# ```bash
# # Use descriptive names
# git checkout -b fix/temperature-calculation
# # NOT: git checkout -b mybranch
# # NOT: git checkout -b temp
# ```
#
# **Branch naming conventions:**
# - `feature/add-wind-speed-model` - New functionality
# - `fix/correct-precipitation-units` - Bug fixes
# - `docs/update-api-reference` - Documentation
# - `refactor/simplify-data-loading` - Code improvements
# - `test/add-climate-validation` - Test additions
#
# **Step 3: Make your changes**
# ```bash
# # Edit files, test locally
# python simulate_climate.py
# pytest tests/
#
# # Commit with clear messages
# git add src/temperature.py tests/test_temperature.py
# git commit -m "Fix temperature calculation for polar regions
#
# - Correct formula for temperatures below -50°C
# - Add test cases for Arctic/Antarctic conditions
# - Resolves issue #42"
# ```
#
# **Step 4: Push your branch**
# ```bash
# git push origin fix/temperature-calculation
# ```
#
# **Step 5: Open a pull request**
# - Go to GitHub/GitLab repository
# - Click "New Pull Request" / "New Merge Request"
# - Select: `main` ← `fix/temperature-calculation`
# - Fill in the PR template (see next section)
# - Request reviewers
# - Submit
#
# **Step 6: Address review comments**
# ```bash
# # Make requested changes
# git add src/temperature.py
# git commit -m "Address review: Add bounds checking"
# git push origin fix/temperature-calculation
# # PR updates automatically!
# ```
#
# **Step 7: Merge after approval**
# - Reviewer approves
# - CI tests pass ✅
# - Merge the PR (squash, rebase, or merge commit - team decision)
# - Delete the feature branch
#
# ### Platform Comparison: GitHub vs GitLab
#
# **GitHub Pull Requests:**
# - Called "Pull Requests" (PRs)
# - Located: Repository → Pull requests tab
# - Can assign reviewers, labels, milestones
# - Draft PRs available for work-in-progress
# - Can require approval before merging
# - Supports automated review requests
#
# **GitLab Merge Requests:**
# - Called "Merge Requests" (MRs)
# - Located: Repository → Merge requests
# - Similar review and approval workflow
# - Additional features: Approval rules, merge trains
# - Can mark MRs as "Work in Progress" (WIP)
# - Supports multiple approval rules per repository
#
# **Both platforms support:**
# - Inline code comments
# - Discussion threads
# - CI/CD integration
# - Protected branch rules
# - Auto-merge when conditions met

# ## Part 3: Writing Effective Pull Requests
#
# ### The Anatomy of a Good PR
#
# A pull request is **documentation** of your changes. Make it easy for reviewers
# to understand what you did and why.
#
# **Bad PR description:**
# ```
# Title: Fix bug
#
# Description: Fixed the thing
# ```
#
# **Good PR description:**
# ```
# Title: Fix temperature calculation for polar regions
#
# ## Problem
# Temperature calculations were producing incorrect values for regions with
# temperatures below -50°C. The current formula doesn't account for the
# non-linear behavior of air at extreme cold.
#
# ## Solution
# - Updated temperature calculation formula in src/temperature.py
# - Added special handling for temperatures < -50°C
# - Implemented the Clausius-Clapeyron relation for polar conditions
#
# ## Testing
# - Added unit tests for Arctic and Antarctic test cases
# - Validated against NSIDC observational data
# - All existing tests still pass
#
# ## References
# - Fixes #42
# - Related to climate model validation project
# - Based on formula from Smith et al. (2023), J. Climate
#
# ## Checklist
# - [x] Tests added and passing
# - [x] Documentation updated
# - [x] CHANGELOG.md updated
# - [x] Code follows project style guide
# ```
#
# ### PR Template
#

# ## Part 4: Code Review - The Art of Constructive Feedback
#
# ### Why Code Review Matters
#
# Code review is **not** about finding faults - it's about:
# - ✅ **Catching bugs** before they reach production
# - ✅ **Sharing knowledge** across the team
# - ✅ **Maintaining consistency** in code style and practices
# - ✅ **Improving design** through discussion
# - ✅ **Onboarding** new contributors
# - ✅ **Building quality culture** in the team
#
# Research shows code review catches 60% of defects that would slip through testing.
#
# ### What to Look for in Code Review
#
# **1. Correctness**
# - Does the code do what it claims?
# - Are algorithms implemented correctly?
# - Are edge cases handled?
# - Are units and dimensions correct? (Critical in scientific code!)
#
# ```python
# # ❌ Problematic
# def calculate_energy(mass):
#     return mass * 3e8 ** 2  # Should this be (3e8)**2?
#
# # ✅ Better
# def calculate_energy_joules(mass_kg):
#     """Calculate energy using E=mc^2.
#
#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     mass_kg : float
#         Mass in kilograms
#
#     Returns
#     -------
#     float
#         Energy in joules
#     """
#     SPEED_OF_LIGHT_M_PER_S = 299792458  # m/s
#     return mass_kg * SPEED_OF_LIGHT_M_PER_S ** 2
# ```
#
# **2. Testing**
# - Are there tests for new functionality?
# - Do tests cover edge cases?
# - Are test names descriptive?
#
# ```python
# # ❌ Weak test
# def test_calc():
#     assert calculate_energy(1) > 0
#
# # ✅ Strong test
# def test_calculate_energy_for_one_kg():
#     """Test E=mc^2 for 1 kg mass."""
#     mass_kg = 1.0
#     expected_joules = 8.987551787e16  # 1 kg * c^2
#     actual_joules = calculate_energy_joules(mass_kg)
#     assert abs(actual_joules - expected_joules) < 1e10  # Within 0.01%
# ```
#
# **3. Documentation**
# - Are functions documented?
# - Is complex logic explained?
# - Are assumptions stated?
# - Are units specified?
#
# **4. Code Style and Readability**
# - Consistent with project conventions?
# - Variable names descriptive?
# - Functions small and focused?
# - No unnecessary complexity?
#
# **5. Performance (when relevant)**
# - Are there obvious inefficiencies?
# - Is the approach scalable?
# - Are there better algorithms available?
#
# **6. Security (when relevant)**
# - Are user inputs validated?
# - Are file paths sanitized?
# - Are credentials handled safely?
#
# ### How to Give Constructive Feedback
#
# **❌ Destructive comments:**
# ```
# "This code is terrible"
# "Did you even test this?"
# "You obviously don't understand Python"
# "Why would you do it this way?"
# ```
#
# **✅ Constructive comments:**
# ```
# "This implementation might have issues with negative inputs.
#  Could we add input validation?"
#
# "I think we could simplify this by using numpy.clip() here.
#  What do you think?"
#
# "Great approach! One suggestion: adding a docstring would help
#  future contributors understand the algorithm."
#
# "I'm not sure I understand the logic here. Could you add a
#  comment explaining why we multiply by 2?"
# ```
#
# ### The "Yes, and..." Technique
#
# Instead of "No, but..." use "Yes, and...":
#
# **❌ "No, but..."**
# ```
# "No, this won't work for large datasets."
# ```
#
# **✅ "Yes, and..."**
# ```
# "This works well for small datasets! For scaling to larger data,
#  we might want to consider using Dask for parallel processing.
#  What do you think about implementing that as a follow-up PR?"
# ```
#
# ### Praise Good Work
#
# Don't just point out problems - acknowledge good work:
#
# ```
# "Excellent test coverage! The edge cases you covered will prevent
#  bugs down the line."
#
# "I really like how you documented the assumptions. This makes the
#  code much easier to understand."
#
# "Smart optimization! Using vectorization here is much cleaner than
#  the loop we had before."
# ```

#     <p>Ready to practice constructive code review? Try these approaches:</p>
#     <ul>
#         <li><strong>Review a colleague's code</strong>: Ask a lab mate if you can review
#         one of their recent PRs or scripts. Focus on being helpful, not critical. Did
#         they appreciate your feedback?</li>
#         <li><strong>Get your code reviewed</strong>: Share a small piece of your code and
#         explicitly ask for feedback on readability and design. What did you learn? What
#         surprised you?</li>
#         <li><strong>Practice "Yes, and..."</strong>: Next time you see code you'd do
#         differently, start your comment with "This works, and we could also..." Notice
#         how the tone changes!</li>
#     </ul>
# </div>

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 5: Handling Review Feedback
#
# ### Receiving Feedback Professionally
#
# **Remember:**
# - Reviewers are critiquing **code**, not **you**
# - Everyone's goal is better software
# - Even experienced developers get feedback
# - Questions are opportunities to improve documentation
#
# **Good responses to feedback:**
#
# ```
# "Great catch! I'll add input validation."
#
# "Good point about edge cases. I've added tests for empty arrays."
#
# "I hadn't considered that scenario. Let me update the implementation."
#
# "You're right that the docstring was unclear. I've rewritten it."
#
# "Interesting suggestion! I chose approach A because of memory
#  constraints, but let me document that decision in a comment."
# ```
#
# ### When to Push Back (Politely)
#
# It's okay to disagree if you have good reasons:
#
# ```
# "I considered using approach B, but it performs poorly with our
#  typical dataset sizes (see benchmark results attached). I think
#  approach A is better for our use case, but I'm open to discussion."
#
# "The additional abstraction you suggested would be valuable if we
#  had multiple implementations. Since this is our only use case,
#  I think the simpler approach is more maintainable. What do you think?"
# ```
#
# ### Resolving Disagreements
#
# If you and reviewers disagree:
#
# **1. Understand their perspective**
# - Ask clarifying questions
# - Consider their expertise
# - Look for the underlying concern
#
# **2. Provide context**
# - Explain your reasoning
# - Share relevant benchmarks/data
# - Reference documentation or papers
#
# **3. Seek consensus**
# - Propose compromises
# - Invite third opinions
# - Focus on project goals, not personal preference
#
# **4. Document the decision**
# - Add comments explaining why you chose this approach
# - Update documentation if needed
# - Record decision in PR discussion for future reference

# ## Part 5.5: Code Review for Software Architecture
#
# Beyond checking for correctness and style, effective code reviews also evaluate **software
# architecture and design quality**. This is especially important in research software, where
# code often evolves from a quick prototype to a critical analysis pipeline used by many people.
#
# Reviewing architecture helps prevent technical debt and ensures code remains maintainable as
# projects grow. Let's learn how to review code for design quality, not just bugs.
#
# ### Why Architectural Review Matters
#
# **Story**: A research team merged a PR that "worked perfectly." Three months later, they needed
# to add a new analysis type. The code was so tightly coupled that adding the feature required
# rewriting 40% of the codebase. A 5-minute architectural review during the PR would have caught
# the design issue early.
#
# **Architectural problems compound**: A poorly designed function becomes a poorly designed module,
# then a poorly designed system. Catching design issues in review prevents expensive refactoring later.
#
# **What architectural review catches**:
# - Code smells (from Lecture 5): god functions, tight coupling, duplication
# - Violation of design principles (from Lecture 4): DRY, single responsibility
# - Technical debt accumulation (from Lecture 7): quick hacks that should be refactored
# - Missing abstractions or poor API design
# - Inconsistent patterns across the codebase
#
# ### Architectural Review Checklist
#
# When reviewing a PR, ask these design-focused questions:
#
# #### 1. Design Principles (Lecture 4)
#
# **DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself**
# ```python
# # ❌ Code smell in PR:
# def analyze_temp_2019(data):
#     mean = sum(data) / len(data)
#     variance = sum((x - mean)**2 for x in data) / len(data)
#     return mean, variance
#
# def analyze_temp_2020(data):
#     mean = sum(data) / len(data)
#     variance = sum((x - mean)**2 for x in data) / len(data)
#     return mean, variance
#
# # Review comment:
# # "These functions duplicate the statistics calculation. Could we extract
# #  a shared calculate_statistics(data) function and call it from both?"
# ```
#
# **Single Responsibility Principle**
# ```python
# # ❌ Violates SRP:
# def process_experiment(filename):
#     # Loads data
#     # Cleans data
#     # Analyzes data
#     # Generates plots
#     # Saves results
#     # Sends email notification
#     pass  # 300 lines of mixed concerns
#
# # Review comment:
# # "This function has too many responsibilities. Consider splitting into:
# #  - load_data(filename)
# #  - clean_data(raw_data)
# #  - analyze_data(clean_data)
# #  - save_results(results, output_path)
# # This would make testing easier and allow reuse of individual steps."
# ```
#
# **Separation of Concerns**
# ```python
# # ❌ Mixes calculation with I/O:
# def calculate_correlation(file1, file2):
#     with open(file1) as f:
#         data1 = [float(line) for line in f]
#     with open(file2) as f:
#         data2 = [float(line) for line in f]
#     # correlation calculation...
#
# # Review comment:
# # "This function mixes file I/O with calculation logic. Suggest:
# #  def calculate_correlation(data1, data2):  # Pure calculation
# #      ...
# # This makes it testable without creating files and reusable with
# # data from databases, APIs, or other sources."
# ```
#
# #### 2. Code Smells (Lecture 5)
#
# **Watch for these red flags in PRs:**
#
# | Smell | What to Look For | Review Comment Example |
# |-------|------------------|------------------------|
# | **God Function** | Function > 50 lines, multiple tasks | "Could we split this into smaller functions?" |
# | **Magic Numbers** | Unexplained constants like `273.15` | "Consider extracting this as KELVIN_OFFSET" |
# | **Tight Coupling** | Function depends on internals of other classes | "Accept simple parameters instead of whole object" |
# | **Global State** | Uses/modifies global variables | "Pass this as a parameter for testability" |
# | **Poor Naming** | Variables like `tmp`, `x2`, `calc` | "More descriptive names would help readability" |
# | **Duplication** | Same logic in multiple places | "Extract shared logic to avoid duplication" |
#
# **Example review comment addressing smell:**
# ```
# The new process_climate_data() function looks like it's doing a lot.
# I count at least 6 different responsibilities (loading, validation,
# transformation, analysis, visualization, export). This makes it hard
# to test and reuse.
#
# Suggestion: Could we split this into a pipeline of smaller functions?
# That would also make it easier to profile performance bottlenecks later.
#
# See Lecture 5 code smells section for the "God Function" anti-pattern.
# ```
#
# #### 3. API Design and Consistency
#
# **Check for consistent patterns across the codebase:**
#
# ```python
# # ❌ Inconsistent API in PR:
# # Existing code:
# def load_temperature_data(filename, units='celsius'):
#     """Load data with configurable units."""
#     pass
#
# # New code in PR:
# def load_pressure_data(filename):
#     """Load pressure data in pascals only."""
#     pass
#
# # Review comment:
# # "For consistency with load_temperature_data(), should we add a units
# #  parameter here too? Future users might need different pressure units
# #  (Pa, hPa, bar, etc.). API consistency makes the library easier to learn."
# ```
#
# **Look for good abstractions:**
# ```python
# # ✅ Good abstraction in PR:
# def load_scientific_data(filename, data_type, units=None):
#     """Generic loader for any scientific data type."""
#     # Handles temperature, pressure, humidity, etc.
#     pass
#
# # Review comment:
# # "Nice abstraction! This unifies our data loading interface and will
# #  make adding new data types easier. One suggestion: document the
# #  supported data_type values in the docstring."
# ```
#
# #### 4. Testability
#
# **Hard-to-test code is often poorly designed code (Lecture 5 connection):**
#
# ```python
# # ❌ Hard to test (no tests in PR):
# def analyze_experiment():
#     data = load_from_database(DB_CONNECTION_STRING)  # Global!
#     results = complex_analysis(data)
#     save_to_file('results.csv', results)
#     return results
#
# # Review comment:
# # "This function is hard to test because it depends on a database and
# #  writes to files. Could we refactor to:
# #
# #  def analyze_experiment(data):
# #      return complex_analysis(data)
# #
# #  Then the caller handles I/O, and we can easily test the analysis
# #  logic with simple test data. This follows separation of concerns."
# ```
#
# #### 5. Future Maintainability
#
# **Think about code evolution:**
#
# ```python
# # Review question:
# # "If we need to support a new instrument type in 6 months, would this
# #  design make that easy or would we need major refactoring?"
#
# # Review question:
# # "If we need to parallelize this computation, is the design amenable
# #  to that? (No global state, pure functions, etc.)"
#
# # Review question:
# # "When we publish this code, will external users find the API clear
# #  and intuitive?"
# ```
#
# ### When to Suggest Refactoring in Review
#
# **The refactoring judgment call:**
#
# ✅ **Do suggest refactoring when:**
# - Design issue makes code hard to test (blocks quality)
# - Pattern violates established project standards (consistency)
# - Change will prevent future bugs (safety)
# - Refactoring is localized and low-risk (small change)
# - PR is already touching that code (no extra churn)
#
# ⚠️ **Don't insist on refactoring when:**
# - Change is purely aesthetic (nitpicking)
# - Refactoring would expand PR scope significantly (scope creep)
# - Code is temporary/experimental (premature optimization)
# - Team has more urgent priorities (time constraints)
# - Author is new contributor (overwhelming)
#
# **Balance is key**: Focus on architectural issues that matter, not perfection.
#
# ### How to Give Architectural Feedback Constructively
#
# **Bad review comment** (sounds like criticism):
# ```
# This design is wrong. You should use the strategy pattern here.
# ```
#
# **Good review comment** (collaborative and educational):
# ```
# This function is doing a lot! I wonder if we could simplify by extracting
# the file I/O from the calculation logic? That would make it easier to test
# and reuse. What do you think?
#
# For reference, see Lecture 4's section on Separation of Concerns. Happy
# to discuss alternatives if you have thoughts on this!
# ```
#
# **Components of good architectural feedback:**
#
# 1. **Explain the problem**: "This makes testing hard because..."
# 2. **Suggest a solution**: "Could we extract this into..."
# 3. **Explain the benefit**: "This would make it easier to..."
# 4. **Ask, don't demand**: "What do you think?"
# 5. **Provide references**: "See Lecture 5 on code smells"
# 6. **Offer to discuss**: "Happy to chat if you want to explore options"
#
# ### Balancing Nitpicking vs. Structural Issues
#
# **Not all review comments are equally important. Prioritize:**
#
# **🔴 Critical (must fix before merge):**
# - Correctness bugs
# - Security vulnerabilities
# - Breaking changes to public APIs
# - Major architectural flaws (god functions, tight coupling)
# - Missing tests for critical functionality
#
# **🟡 Important (should fix, but negotiable):**
# - Minor design improvements
# - Inconsistencies with project patterns
# - Missing documentation
# - Performance concerns
# - Code smells that hinder maintenance
#
# **🟢 Nice-to-have (optional suggestions):**
# - Style preferences
# - Variable naming improvements
# - Additional test cases for rare edge cases
# - Refactoring opportunities
#
# **Mark priority in reviews:**
# ```
# [Critical] This function modifies global state, which will cause race
# conditions in our parallel processing pipeline. We must fix this.
#
# [Important] The duplicated logic here violates DRY. Suggest extracting
# to a shared function for maintainability.
#
# [Nit] Consider renaming 'tmp' to 'temporary_values' for clarity.
# ```
#
# ### Spotting Architectural Smells Across PRs
#
# **Watch for patterns across multiple PRs:**
#
# - **All PRs adding similar code** → Missing abstraction
# - **Many PRs touching same file** → God file/class
# - **PRs constantly fixing bugs in same area** → Design issue
# - **PRs blocked on merge conflicts** → Tight coupling
# - **Hard to review large PRs** → Functions doing too much
#
# **Team-level action:**
# ```
# "I've noticed 3 recent PRs all duplicate the same statistics calculation.
#  Should we refactor to extract a shared stats module? This would prevent
#  future duplication and make testing centralized."
# ```
#
# ### Code Review: A Learning Opportunity
#
# **Reviews teach design skills both ways:**
#
# **For reviewers:**
# - See how others solve similar problems
# - Learn new patterns and idioms
# - Practice articulating design principles
#
# **For authors:**
# - Get feedback on design choices
# - Learn team standards and expectations
# - Improve design skills through iteration
#
# **Research software insight**: Many researchers haven't had formal software engineering
# training. Code review is how we collectively learn good design. Be patient, be educational,
# and remember: we're all learning together.
#
# ### Key Takeaways: Architectural Code Review
#
# 1. **Look beyond correctness** - review for maintainability and design quality
# 2. **Apply principles from Lectures 4-5** - DRY, SRP, code smells
# 3. **Think about future evolution** - will this design adapt well?
# 4. **Balance perfectionism and pragmatism** - not every issue needs fixing now
# 5. **Be constructive and educational** - reviews are learning opportunities
# 6. **Prioritize feedback** - critical vs. important vs. nice-to-have
# 7. **Catch patterns early** - prevent architectural debt from accumulating
#
# **Connection to earlier lectures:**
# - **Lecture 4**: Apply design principles in review
# - **Lecture 5**: Spot code smells in PRs
# - **Lecture 7**: Suggest refactoring when profiling reveals issues
#
# **Remember**: The goal is not perfect code—it's code that works correctly, is maintainable,
# and enables the team to do great science together!

# ## Part 6: Merge Conflicts and How to Handle Them
#
# ### Understanding Merge Conflicts
#
# A **merge conflict** occurs when Git can't automatically merge changes because
# multiple people edited the same lines of code differently.
#
# **Scenario:**
# ```python
# # Original code in main branch
# def calculate_temperature(kelvin):
#     return kelvin - 273.15
# ```
#
# **Your branch:**
# ```python
# def calculate_temperature(kelvin):
#     """Convert Kelvin to Celsius."""
#     return kelvin - 273.15
# ```
#
# **Colleague's branch (merged first):**
# ```python
# def calculate_temperature_celsius(kelvin):
#     return kelvin - 273.15
# ```
#
# When you try to merge, Git doesn't know which change to keep.
#
# ### Resolving Conflicts - Step by Step
#
# **Step 1: Update your branch**
# ```bash
# # On your feature branch
# git checkout fix/temperature-calculation
# git fetch origin
# git merge origin/main
# # Conflict detected!
# ```
#
# **Step 2: Identify conflicting files**
# ```bash
# git status
# # Shows:
# # both modified:   src/temperature.py
# ```
#
# **Step 3: Open the file and examine conflict markers**
# ```python
# <<<<<<< HEAD (your changes)
# def calculate_temperature(kelvin):
#     """Convert Kelvin to Celsius."""
#     return kelvin - 273.15
# =======
# def calculate_temperature_celsius(kelvin):
#     return kelvin - 273.15
# >>>>>>> origin/main (their changes)
# ```
#
# **Step 4: Resolve the conflict**
#
# You need to decide how to combine the changes. Options:
# - Keep your version only
# - Keep their version only
# - Combine both changes
# - Write something entirely new
#
# ```python
# # Resolution: Keep rename and add docstring
# def calculate_temperature_celsius(kelvin):
#     """Convert temperature from Kelvin to Celsius.
#
#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     kelvin : float
#         Temperature in Kelvin
#
#     Returns
#     -------
#     float
#         Temperature in Celsius
#     """
#     return kelvin - 273.15
# ```
#
# **Step 5: Mark as resolved and commit**
# ```bash
# git add src/temperature.py
# git commit -m "Merge main and resolve temperature function conflict
#
# - Kept function rename from main branch
# - Added docstring from feature branch"
# git push origin fix/temperature-calculation
# ```
#
# ### Preventing Conflicts
#
# **Best practices:**
# - ✅ **Keep PRs small** - easier to review and merge
# - ✅ **Sync frequently** - merge main into your branch regularly
# - ✅ **Communicate** - let team know what you're working on
# - ✅ **Modular code** - different people work on different modules
# - ✅ **Fast reviews** - don't let PRs sit for weeks
#
# ### GitLab Merge Strategies
#
# Both GitHub and GitLab offer different merge strategies:
#
# **1. Merge Commit** (default)
# - Creates explicit merge commit
# - Preserves full history
# - Can make history complex
#
# **2. Squash and Merge**
# - Combines all commits into one
# - Clean linear history
# - Loses intermediate commit history
#
# **3. Rebase and Merge**
# - Replays commits on top of main
# - Linear history without merge commits
# - Rewrites commit history (use with care)
#
# **Team decision**: Choose one strategy and document it in CONTRIBUTING.md

# ## Part 7: Onboarding New Team Members
#
# ### The First Day Experience
#
# **Bad onboarding:**
# ```
# "Here's the repository. Good luck!"
# ```
# Result: Confused contributor, wasted time, frustration
#
# **Good onboarding:**
# - Welcome message with clear first steps
# - Documentation for setting up development environment
# - "Good first issue" labels on suitable tasks
# - Designated mentor for questions
# - Checklist of onboarding tasks
#
# ### Creating a CONTRIBUTING.md
#
# Every project should have clear contribution guidelines:
#
# ```markdown

# - Use descriptive test names: `test_<what>_<condition>_<expected>`
#
# ## Pull Request Process
#
# 1. Fill in the PR template completely
# 2. Request review from at least one team member
# 3. Address all review comments
# 4. Ensure CI tests pass
# 5. Squash commits before merging (if requested)
#
# ## Code Review Guidelines
#
# - Reviews should be completed within 2 business days
# - Be constructive and respectful
# - Focus on code, not the person
# - Ask questions rather than make demands
# - Acknowledge good work
#
# ## Getting Help
#
# - Questions about code: Open a GitHub Discussion

# - Security issues: Email security@example.org
# - General chat: Join our Slack channel
#
# ## Good First Issues
#
# Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` - these are specifically
# selected for new contributors and include extra guidance.
# ```
#
# ### Mentoring New Contributors
#
# **For new contributors, be extra supportive:**
#
# ```
# "Welcome! Thanks for your first contribution to the project.
#
#  I see you're working on [feature]. Here are a few tips:
#  - Our test files are in tests/
#  - We use pytest for testing
#  - Check out other test files for examples
#
#  Don't hesitate to ask questions - we're here to help!"
# ```
#
# **When reviewing first PRs:**
# - Be encouraging
# - Explain the "why" behind suggestions
# - Point to examples in the codebase
# - Acknowledge effort
# - Offer to pair program for complex changes

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 8: Communication and Team Dynamics
#
# ### Choosing the Right Communication Channel
#
# Different channels for different purposes:
#
# **GitHub/GitLab Issues:**
# - Bug reports
# - Feature requests
# - Task tracking
# - Public, searchable, permanent
#
# **Pull/Merge Request comments:**
# - Code-specific discussions
# - Implementation questions
# - Review feedback
# - Tied to specific changes
#
# **GitHub Discussions / GitLab Wikis:**
# - General questions
# - Design discussions
# - Community announcements
# - Less formal than issues
#
# **Slack/Discord/Mattermost:**
# - Quick questions
# - Real-time collaboration
# - Team coordination
# - Not searchable long-term (free tiers)
#
# **Email:**
# - Formal communications
# - External collaborators
# - Confidential matters
# - Long-form discussions
#
# **Video calls:**
# - Complex discussions
# - Pair programming
# - Team meetings
# - Onboarding sessions
#
# **Rule of thumb:**
# - Decisions should be documented in GitHub/GitLab
# - Chat is for quick coordination
# - If a chat discussion leads to a decision, document it in an issue
#
# ### Asynchronous Collaboration
#
# Research teams are often distributed across time zones. Write for async:
#
# **❌ Synchronous-dependent:**
# ```
# "Can we discuss this?"
# (6 hours later)
# "Never mind, I figured it out"
# ```
#
# **✅ Async-friendly:**
# ```
# "I'm considering two approaches for the data preprocessing:
#
#  Approach A: Pandas with chunked reading
#  - Pros: Familiar to team, easy to debug
#  - Cons: Memory intensive for large files
#
#  Approach B: Dask for out-of-core processing
#  - Pros: Scales to large datasets
#  - Cons: More complex, adds dependency
#
#  I'm leaning toward A for now since our datasets are <1GB.
#  Thoughts? I'll implement A tomorrow unless concerns are raised."
# ```
#
# ### Handling Disagreements Professionally
#
# Disagreements are normal and healthy - if handled well:
#
# **1. Assume good intentions**
# - Everyone wants the project to succeed
# - People have different backgrounds and perspectives
# - Misunderstandings happen in text communication
#
# **2. Focus on technical merits**
# - Discuss trade-offs objectively
# - Use benchmarks and data when possible
# - Separate personal preference from technical requirements
#
# **3. Escalate when needed**
# - If consensus can't be reached, involve team lead
# - Document both perspectives
# - Accept decisions gracefully
#
# **4. Learn from conflict**
# - Update guidelines to prevent future disagreements
# - Clarify decision-making processes
# - Improve documentation

# ## Part 9: Collaboration Beyond Python
#
# ### Language-Specific Collaboration Practices
#
# The principles of collaboration are universal, but tools differ by ecosystem.
#
# ### R Projects
#
# **Version Control:**
# - Git workflow identical to Python
# - Pull requests work the same way
#
# **Code Review Focus:**
# ```r
# # ❌ Hard to review
# res <- dat %>% filter(x > 0) %>% group_by(grp) %>%
#        summarize(m = mean(val)) %>% arrange(desc(m))
#
# # ✅ Easier to review (one operation per line)
# res <- dat %>%
#   filter(x > 0) %>%
#   group_by(grp) %>%
#   summarize(mean_value = mean(val)) %>%
#   arrange(desc(mean_value))
# ```
#
# **R-Specific Tools:**
# - `lintr` for code style checking (like flake8 for Python)
# - `testthat` for testing (like pytest)
# - `devtools::check()` for package validation
# - `pkgdown` for documentation websites
#
# **GitLab CI for R:**
# ```yaml
# test:
#   image: rocker/tidyverse:latest
#   script:
#     - R -e "devtools::install_deps()"
#     - R -e "devtools::test()"
#     - R -e "devtools::check()"
# ```
#
# ### C/C++ Projects
#
# **Build System Considerations:**
# - PRs must include build system updates (CMakeLists.txt, Makefile)
# - Cross-platform builds often differ
# - Review must verify compilation on multiple platforms
#
# **Code Review Focus:**
# ```cpp
# // ❌ Potential issues
# char* buffer = new char[size];  // No delete? Memory leak!
# int* data = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));  // Mixed C/C++?
#
# // ✅ Modern C++ practices
# std::vector<char> buffer(size);  // Automatic memory management
# std::unique_ptr<int[]> data(new int[n]);  // Smart pointer
# ```
#
# **Tools:**
# - `clang-format` for automatic code formatting
# - `clang-tidy` for static analysis
# - `cppcheck` for additional checks
# - `valgrind` for memory leak detection
#
# **GitHub Actions for C++:**
# ```yaml
# name: C++ CI
# on: [push, pull_request]
# jobs:
#   build:
#     strategy:
#       matrix:
#         os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
#         compiler: [gcc, clang]
#     runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
#     steps:
#       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
#       - name: Build
#         run: |
#           cmake -B build
#           cmake --build build
#       - name: Test
#         run: ctest --test-dir build
# ```
#
# ### Julia Projects
#
# **Package System:**
# - Dependencies in `Project.toml` (like requirements.txt)
# - Manifest.toml locks exact versions (like conda locks)
#
# **Code Review:**
# ```julia
# # ❌ Type instability (performance issue)
# function compute(x)
#     if x > 0
#         return x  # Float
#     else
#         return 0  # Int - type instability!
#     end
# end
#
# # ✅ Type stable
# function compute(x::Float64)::Float64
#     if x > 0
#         return x
#     else
#         return 0.0
#     end
# end
# ```
#
# **Tools:**
# - `Pkg.test()` runs package tests
# - `JuliaFormatter.jl` for code formatting
# - `Documenter.jl` for documentation
#
# ### Fortran Projects
#
# **Modern Fortran Best Practices:**
# ```fortran
# ! ❌ Old style (hard to review)
#       SUBROUTINE CALC(X,Y,N,RES)
#       IMPLICIT NONE
#       INTEGER N
#       REAL X(N),Y(N),RES
#
# ! ✅ Modern style (clearer intent)
# subroutine calculate_result(input_x, input_y, result)
#     real, dimension(:), intent(in) :: input_x, input_y
#     real, intent(out) :: result
#
#     ! Clear variable roles with intent
# ```
#
# **Tools:**
# - `fprettify` for code formatting
# - `ford` for documentation generation
# - `fpm` (Fortran Package Manager) for modern project structure
#
# ### MATLAB Projects
#
# **Version Control Challenges:**
# - Binary `.mat` files don't diff well
# - Consider exporting to HDF5 or text for version control
#
# **Code Review:**
# ```matlab
# % ❌ Magic numbers
# y = x * 9.81;
#
# % ✅ Named constants
# GRAVITY_M_PER_S2 = 9.81;
# y = x * GRAVITY_M_PER_S2;
# ```
#
# **Tools:**
# - MATLAB's built-in code analyzer (orange squiggles)
# - `checkcode()` function for programmatic checking
# - MATLAB Unit Test framework

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 10: Advanced Collaboration Practices
#
# ### Protected Branches
#
# **Configure repository settings to require:**
# - Pull request reviews before merging
# - Passing CI tests
# - Up-to-date branches
# - Signed commits (for security-critical projects)
#
# **GitHub:**
# Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules
#
# **GitLab:**
# Settings → Repository → Protected branches
#
# **Typical rules:**
# - Require 1-2 approving reviews
# - Require status checks to pass
# - Require branches to be up to date before merging
# - No force pushes to main
# - No deletions of main branch
#
# ### Code Owners (CODEOWNERS)
#
# Automatically request reviews from relevant experts:
#
# **`.github/CODEOWNERS` (GitHub) or `.gitlab/CODEOWNERS` (GitLab):**
# ```
# # Climate physics algorithms
# /src/physics/           @climate-team @physics-lead
#
# # Data processing pipeline
# /src/data/              @data-team
#
# # Documentation
# *.md                    @docs-team
# /docs/                  @docs-team
#
# # CI/CD configuration
# /.github/workflows/     @devops-team
# .gitlab-ci.yml          @devops-team
# ```
#
# When someone opens a PR touching these files, the specified teams/users are
# automatically requested as reviewers.
#
# ### Draft Pull Requests
#
# Use draft PRs for early feedback:
#
# **GitHub:**
# - Create PR and select "Create draft pull request"
# - Mark as "Ready for review" when done
#
# **GitLab:**
# - Prefix title with `Draft:` or `WIP:` (Work in Progress)
# - Remove prefix when ready
#
# **Use cases:**
# - Get early feedback on approach
# - Show progress on complex features
# - Trigger CI without requesting formal review
# - Collaborate on design before implementation complete
#
# ### Pair Programming for Complex Changes
#
# Some changes benefit from real-time collaboration:
#
# **Tools:**
# - **VS Code Live Share**: Real-time collaborative editing
# - **Tuple/Pop**: Pair programming with high-quality screen sharing
# - **Zoom/Google Meet**: Screen sharing for simpler collaboration
#
# **When to pair program:**
# - Onboarding new team members
# - Debugging complex issues
# - Designing critical algorithms
# - Learning new technologies
# - Resolving difficult merge conflicts
#
# **Protocol:**
# - One person "drives" (types)
# - Other person "navigates" (thinks strategically)
# - Switch roles every 20-30 minutes
# - Both stay engaged

# ## Part 11: Real-World Example - Collaborative Bug Fix
#
# Let's walk through a complete example of collaborative development.
#
# ### Scenario: Bug in Climate Model
#
# **Issue #127**: "Temperature model produces NaN for coastal regions"
#
# **Step 1: Lisa reproduces the bug**
# ```python
# # Create test file: tests/test_coastal_temperature.py
# import pytest
# import numpy as np
# from climate_model import calculate_temperature
#
# def test_coastal_temperature_should_not_be_nan():
#     """Coastal regions should produce valid temperature values."""
#     # Coordinates for coastal grid cell
#     lat = 37.8
#     lon = -122.4  # San Francisco Bay
#     land_fraction = 0.5  # 50% land, 50% water
#
#     temp = calculate_temperature(lat, lon, land_fraction)
#
#     assert not np.isnan(temp), "Temperature should not be NaN for coastal cells"
#     assert -50 < temp < 50, "Temperature should be physically reasonable"
# ```
#
# **Step 2: Lisa creates a feature branch**
# ```bash
# git checkout main
# git pull origin main
# git checkout -b fix/coastal-nan-temperature
# ```
#
# **Step 3: Lisa commits the failing test**
# ```bash
# git add tests/test_coastal_temperature.py
# git commit -m "Add test for coastal temperature NaN bug (currently fails)
#
# Documents the bug with a reproducible test case.
# Test will pass once bug is fixed.
#
# Relates to #127"
# git push origin fix/coastal-nan-temperature
# ```
#
# **Step 4: Lisa opens a draft PR**
# ```
# Title: [WIP] Fix coastal temperature NaN bug
#
# ## Problem
# Temperature calculation produces NaN for coastal grid cells where
# land_fraction is between 0 and 1.
#
# ## Current Progress
# - [x] Reproduced bug with test case
# - [ ] Identified root cause
# - [ ] Implemented fix
# - [ ] All tests passing
#
# Relates to #127
# ```
#
# **Step 5: Lisa investigates and finds the bug**
# ```python
# # In src/temperature.py - BEFORE fix
# def calculate_temperature(lat, lon, land_fraction):
#     land_temp = calculate_land_temperature(lat, lon)
#     ocean_temp = calculate_ocean_temperature(lat, lon)
#
#     # BUG: Division by zero when land_fraction is exactly 0.5!
#     weight = (land_fraction - 0.5) / (land_fraction - 0.5)  # Always 1 or NaN!
#
#     return land_temp * weight + ocean_temp * (1 - weight)
# ```
#
# **Step 6: Lisa fixes the bug**
# ```python
# # In src/temperature.py - AFTER fix
# def calculate_temperature(lat, lon, land_fraction):
#     """Calculate temperature for a grid cell.
#
#     For coastal cells (0 < land_fraction < 1), interpolates between
#     land and ocean temperatures based on land fraction.
#
#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     lat : float
#         Latitude in degrees
#     lon : float
#         Longitude in degrees
#     land_fraction : float
#         Fraction of grid cell that is land (0 = all ocean, 1 = all land)
#
#     Returns
#     -------
#     float

#     """
#     land_temp = calculate_land_temperature(lat, lon)
#     ocean_temp = calculate_ocean_temperature(lat, lon)
#
#     # Linear interpolation between land and ocean temperatures
#     return land_temp * land_fraction + ocean_temp * (1 - land_fraction)
# ```
#
# **Step 7: Lisa verifies the fix**
# ```bash
# pytest tests/test_coastal_temperature.py  # Passes!
# pytest tests/  # All tests pass
# ```
#
# **Step 8: Lisa updates the PR**
# ```bash
# git add src/temperature.py
# git commit -m "Fix coastal temperature NaN bug
#
# Root cause: Incorrect interpolation formula was dividing by zero
# for land_fraction = 0.5.
#
# Solution: Use simple linear interpolation between land and ocean
# temperatures based on land_fraction.
#
# The new formula is:
# - temp = land_temp * land_fraction + ocean_temp * (1 - land_fraction)
#
# This correctly handles all values of land_fraction from 0 to 1.
#
# Fixes #127"
# git push origin fix/coastal-nan-temperature
# ```
#
# **Step 9: Lisa marks PR as ready and requests review**
# - Remove [WIP] from title
# - Request review from @james (climate physics expert)
# - Request review from @maya (code quality expert)
#
# **Step 10: James reviews (domain expert)**
# ```
# Comment on the interpolation line:
# "Great fix! The linear interpolation is physically reasonable for
#  coastal cells. One suggestion: for very small land fractions (<0.01),
#  we might want to just use ocean temperature to avoid numerical issues.
#  But that can be a follow-up optimization - this fix is solid."
#
# ✅ Approved
# ```
#
# **Step 11: Maya reviews (code quality expert)**
# ```
# Comment on docstring:
# "Excellent documentation! The formula is now clear.
#
#  Minor suggestion: Could you add a test for the edge cases
#  (land_fraction = 0 and land_fraction = 1) to ensure we didn't
#  break the all-land and all-ocean cases?"
#
# 🔄 Request changes
# ```
#
# **Step 12: Lisa addresses feedback**
# ```python
# # Add to tests/test_coastal_temperature.py
# def test_temperature_all_land():
#     """All-land cells should use only land temperature."""
#     temp_land_only = calculate_temperature(lat=40.0, lon=-100.0,
#                                            land_fraction=1.0)
#     expected = calculate_land_temperature(40.0, -100.0)
#     assert temp_land_only == expected
#
# def test_temperature_all_ocean():
#     """All-ocean cells should use only ocean temperature."""
#     temp_ocean_only = calculate_temperature(lat=30.0, lon=-60.0,
#                                             land_fraction=0.0)
#     expected = calculate_ocean_temperature(30.0, -60.0)
#     assert temp_ocean_only == expected
# ```
#
# ```bash
# git add tests/test_coastal_temperature.py
# git commit -m "Add edge case tests for all-land and all-ocean cells
#
# Address review feedback from @maya"
# git push origin fix/coastal-nan-temperature
# ```
#
# **Step 13: Maya re-reviews**
# ```
# "Perfect! The edge case tests are valuable.
#  ✅ Approved"
# ```
#
# **Step 14: Merge!**
# - Both reviewers approved ✅
# - All CI tests pass ✅
# - Branch is up-to-date ✅
# - Click "Squash and merge"
# - Delete branch `fix/coastal-nan-temperature`
#
# **Step 15: Close the issue**
# GitHub automatically closes #127 because commit message said "Fixes #127"
#

# ## Part 12: Summary - Building Collaborative Research Software
#
# ### Key Takeaways
#
# **1. Collaboration requires process**
# - Git alone isn't enough
# - Pull requests provide structure
# - Code review catches bugs and shares knowledge
# - Clear guidelines prevent conflicts
#
# **2. Communication matters**
# - Write clear PR descriptions
# - Give constructive feedback
# - Assume good intentions
# - Document decisions
#
# **3. Make contributing easy**
# - Write CONTRIBUTING.md
# - Label "good first issues"
# - Provide PR templates
# - Welcome new contributors warmly
#
# **4. Tools support people**
# - Protected branches enforce process
# - CODEOWNERS route reviews
# - CI automates quality checks
# - But people make collaboration work
#
# **5. Adapt to your team**
# - Different projects need different workflows
# - Start simple, add process as needed
# - Document your decisions
# - Review and improve regularly
#
# ### The Collaboration Maturity Model
#
# **Level 1: Solo developer**
# - Direct commits to main
# - No reviews
# - Works until team grows
#
# **Level 2: Basic collaboration**
# - Feature branches
# - Pull requests
# - Informal reviews
# - Good for small teams (2-3 people)
#
# **Level 3: Structured process**
# - Required reviews
# - CI/CD integration
# - Contribution guidelines
# - Good for growing teams (4-10 people)
#
# **Level 4: Scaled collaboration**
# - CODEOWNERS
# - Multiple approval rules
# - Automated quality checks
# - Release management process
# - Necessary for large teams (10+ people)
#
# **Start where you are, grow as needed.**
#
# ### Final Thoughts
#
# Good collaboration is about:
# - **Respect** for collaborators' time and expertise
# - **Clarity** in communication and expectations
# - **Quality** in code and reviews
# - **Growth** of both code and people
#
# Research software is better when developed collaboratively. The code becomes
# more robust, the science more reproducible, and the research community stronger.
#
# Your future self - and your future collaborators - will thank you for building
# good collaboration practices from the start.

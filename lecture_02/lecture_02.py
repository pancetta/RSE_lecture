# ## Part 1: Advanced Git Concepts
# 
# ### Git Branching
# 
# Branches allow you to work on different features or experiments without affecting the main codebase.
# 
# #### Why Use Branches?
# 
# - **Isolation**: Work on new features without breaking the main code
# - **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work simultaneously
# - **Experimentation**: Try new ideas safely
# - **Organization**: Separate development, testing, and production code
# 
# #### Basic Branch Commands
# 
# ```bash
# # Create a new branch
# git branch feature-analysis
# 
# # List all branches (* marks current branch)
# git branch
# 
# # Switch to a branch
# git checkout feature-analysis
# 
# # Create and switch in one command
# git checkout -b new-feature
# 
# # Modern alternative (Git 2.23+)
# git switch feature-analysis
# git switch -c new-feature
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# ### Branching Workflow Example
# 
# Let's walk through a typical workflow. This is the pattern you'll use countless times when 
# developing software: create a branch for your work, make your changes, and then merge them back. 
# Working on a branch keeps your main code stable while you experiment or develop new features.
# 
# ```bash
# # Start on main branch
# git checkout main
# 
# # Create a new feature branch
# git checkout -b add-statistics
# 
# # Make changes to your code
# # ... edit files ...
# 
# # Stage and commit changes
# git add analysis.py
# git commit -m "Add mean and median calculations"
# 
# # More changes
# # ... edit files ...
# git add analysis.py
# git commit -m "Add standard deviation calculation"
# 
# # View your branch history
# git log --oneline --graph
# ```
# 
# **Pro tip**: Use descriptive branch names like `fix-data-loading-bug` or `add-visualization-feature` 
# rather than generic names like `test` or `new-branch`. This makes it easier to remember what each 
# branch is for, especially when you're working on multiple features simultaneously.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Merging Branches
# 
# Once your feature is complete and tested, merge it back into the main branch. Git provides 
# different types of merges depending on the situation. Understanding these helps you maintain 
# a clean, readable Git history.
# 
# #### Fast-Forward Merge
# 
# When main hasn't changed since you branched, Git can do a "fast-forward" merge. This simply 
# moves the main branch pointer forward to include your commits—no merge commit is created. 
# It's the simplest and cleanest type of merge.
# 
# ```bash
# # Switch to main
# git checkout main
# 
# # Merge feature branch
# git merge add-statistics
# 
# # Delete the feature branch (optional, but keeps things tidy)
# git branch -d add-statistics
# ```
# 
# #### Three-Way Merge
# 
# When both branches have new commits (for example, if someone else pushed changes to main while 
# you were working on your feature), Git creates a special "merge commit" that combines the changes. 
# This preserves the full history of both branches.
# 
# ```bash
# # Git creates a merge commit
# git checkout main
# git merge add-statistics
# 
# # Git will open an editor for merge commit message
# # Save and close to complete the merge
# ```
# 
# **When does this happen?** This is common in collaborative projects. While you're working on your 
# feature branch, your colleague merges their changes into main. When you go to merge, Git needs to 
# reconcile both sets of changes.

# %% [markdown]
# ![Git Merge Strategies](git_merge_strategies.png)
# 
# The diagrams above show two different merge scenarios:
# 
# **Fast-Forward Merge** (top):
# - Main branch hasn't changed since the feature branch was created
# - Git simply moves the main branch pointer forward
# - No new merge commit needed - clean, linear history
# - Use when: working alone or main hasn't been updated
# 
# **Three-Way Merge** (bottom):
# - Both branches have new commits since they diverged
# - Git creates a new merge commit (M) with two parents
# - Preserves the complete history of both branches
# - Use when: collaborating and main has advanced
# 
# Both are perfectly valid! The type of merge depends on your project's history.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Handling Merge Conflicts
# 
# Conflicts occur when the same lines are changed in both branches. This is actually quite common 
# and nothing to be afraid of! Git is smart enough to merge most changes automatically, but when 
# two people edit the exact same lines, Git needs you to decide which version to keep (or how to 
# combine them).
# 
# ```bash
# # When a conflict occurs
# git merge feature-branch
# # Auto-merging file.py
# # CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.py
# # Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
# 
# # Check which files have conflicts
# git status
# 
# # Open conflicted files - you'll see markers like:
# # <<<<<<< HEAD
# # Your changes
# # =======
# # Their changes
# # >>>>>>> feature-branch
# 
# # Edit files to resolve conflicts
# # Remove conflict markers
# # Keep the code you want
# 
# # Stage resolved files
# git add file.py
# 
# # Complete the merge
# git commit -m "Merge feature-branch, resolved conflicts"
# ```
# 
# **How to resolve conflicts**: Open the file and look for the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` 
# markers. The section between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` is your current branch's version. The 
# section between `=======` and `>>>>>>> feature-branch` is the incoming branch's version. Delete 
# the markers and edit the code to include the changes you want to keep. Sometimes you'll keep one 
# version, sometimes the other, and sometimes you'll combine both. After editing, save the file, 
# stage it with `git add`, and complete the merge with `git commit`.
# 
# **Common mistake**: Forgetting to remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, etc.) from your code. 
# If you leave them in, your code won't run! Always check that the final version is valid code 
# before committing.

#     <h4 style="color: #7b1fa2; margin-top: 0;">💡 Try It Yourself</h4>
#     <p>Master Git branching and conflict resolution:</p>
#     <ul>
#         <li><strong>Create an intentional conflict:</strong> Make two branches that modify the same
#         line in different ways, then practice resolving the conflict manually</li>
#         <li><strong>Experiment with merge strategies:</strong> Try both fast-forward and three-way
#         merges. Use <code>git log --graph</code> to visualize the differences in history</li>
#         <li><strong>Practice the feature branch workflow:</strong> Create a branch for a small
#         feature, make several commits, then merge it back to main with a descriptive commit
#         message</li>
#     </ul>
# </div>

# %% [markdown]
# ### The .gitignore File
# 
# Not all files should be tracked by Git. Some files are generated automatically (like compiled code), 
# some are too large (like data files), and some contain sensitive information (like API keys). The 
# `.gitignore` file tells Git which files to ignore completely.
# 
# Use `.gitignore` to exclude:
# - **Build artifacts and compiled code**: These are regenerated from source code
# - **Dependencies**: Like `node_modules/` or `venv/` – these can be recreated from requirements files
# - **Temporary files**: Cache files, log files, etc.
# - **Sensitive data**: Passwords, API keys, tokens – NEVER commit these!
# - **Large data files**: Git isn't designed for large binary files; use Git LFS or store separately
# 
# **Why this matters**: Including generated files in Git creates unnecessary noise in your history 
# and can cause merge conflicts when different machines generate slightly different versions. Worse, 
# accidentally committing API keys or passwords can be a serious security breach.
# 
# #### Common .gitignore Patterns
# 
# ```gitignore
# # Python
# __pycache__/
# *.pyc
# *.pyo
# *.pyd
# .Python
# venv/
# env/
# *.egg-info/
# dist/
# build/
# 
# # Jupyter
# .ipynb_checkpoints/
# *.ipynb_checkpoints
# 
# # Data files (be careful with research data!)
# *.csv
# *.dat
# data/*.txt
# 
# # OS files
# .DS_Store
# Thumbs.db
# 
# # IDE
# .vscode/
# .idea/
# *.swp
# 
# # Specific files
# secrets.txt
# config_local.py
# ```
# 
# Create a `.gitignore` file in your repository root and Git will automatically ignore matching files.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Best Practices for Branching
# 
# 1. **Keep branches focused**: One feature or fix per branch
# 2. **Use descriptive names**: `fix-data-loading` not `temp` or `test`
# 3. **Merge or delete completed branches**: Don't let them pile up
# 4. **Pull before you push**: Get latest changes from remote
# 5. **Commit often on branches**: Makes it easier to track progress

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 2: GitHub Collaboration
# 
# ### GitHub Workflow Basics
# 
# GitHub extends Git with collaboration features:
# 
# #### Forking a Repository
# 
# - Click "Fork" on GitHub to create your own copy
# - Clone your fork locally
# - Make changes on a branch
# - Push to your fork
# - Create a Pull Request to propose changes
# 
# #### Pull Requests (PRs)
# 
# A Pull Request is a request to merge your changes into another repository:
# 
# 1. **Create**: After pushing a branch to GitHub, click "New Pull Request"
# 2. **Describe**: Explain what changes you made and why
# 3. **Review**: Others can comment on your code
# 4. **Update**: Push new commits to address feedback
# 5. **Merge**: Maintainer merges when ready
# 
# #### Working with Remotes
# 
# ```bash
# # View remote repositories
# git remote -v
# 
# # Add a remote (e.g., upstream original)
# git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo.git
# 
# # Fetch changes from remote
# git fetch origin
# git fetch upstream
# 
# # Pull changes (fetch + merge)
# git pull origin main
# 
# # Push your changes
# git push origin my-branch
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# ### GitHub Best Practices
# 
# 1. **Write clear PR descriptions**: Explain the problem and solution
# 2. **Keep PRs focused**: Small, reviewable changes
# 3. **Respond to reviews**: Address feedback promptly
# 4. **Use Issues**: Track bugs and feature requests
# 5. **Document in README**: Help others understand your project

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 2b: GitLab Collaboration
# 
# GitLab is another popular platform for Git repository hosting and collaboration.
# While similar to GitHub, GitLab has some unique features and terminology.
# 
# ### GitLab vs GitHub: Key Differences
# 
# - **Merge Requests** (GitLab) vs **Pull Requests** (GitHub)
# - GitLab can be self-hosted or used on GitLab.com
# - Integrated CI/CD pipelines built into GitLab
# - Different interface and feature set
# 
# ### Forking in GitLab
# 
# Forking in GitLab works similarly to GitHub:
# 
# 1. **Navigate** to the project you want to fork
# 2. **Click "Fork"** in the upper-right corner
# 3. **Choose namespace**: Select where to create your fork (personal namespace or group)
# 4. **Configure fork options**:
#    - Edit project name and slug (URL)
#    - Choose which branches to include (all branches or only default)
#    - Set visibility level (public, internal, or private)
# 5. **Create fork**: GitLab creates your personal copy
# 
# #### Keeping Your Fork Updated
# 
# ```bash
# # Add the upstream repository
# git remote add upstream https://gitlab.com/original-owner/project.git
# 
# # View your remotes
# git remote -v
# # origin    https://gitlab.com/your-username/project.git (fetch)
# # origin    https://gitlab.com/your-username/project.git (push)
# # upstream  https://gitlab.com/original-owner/project.git (fetch)
# # upstream  https://gitlab.com/original-owner/project.git (push)
# 
# # Fetch changes from upstream
# git fetch upstream
# 
# # Merge upstream changes into your main branch
# git checkout main
# git merge upstream/main
# 
# # Push updates to your fork
# git push origin main
# ```
# 
# GitLab also provides a UI button to update your fork directly from the web interface.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Merge Requests in GitLab
# 
# Merge Requests (MRs) are GitLab's equivalent to GitHub's Pull Requests.
# 
# #### Creating a Merge Request
# 
# ```bash
# # Create a new branch in your fork
# git checkout -b feature-improvement
# 
# # Make your changes
# # ... edit files ...
# 
# # Commit and push to your fork
# git add .
# git commit -m "Add feature improvement"
# git push origin feature-improvement
# ```
# 
# Then on GitLab:
# 
# 1. **Navigate** to your fork on GitLab
# 2. **Click "Create merge request"** (appears after pushing a branch)
# 3. **Configure the merge request**:
#    - Choose source branch (your feature branch)
#    - Choose target branch (usually `main` in upstream)
#    - Select target project (upstream repository)
# 4. **Write description**: Explain your changes
#    - Use merge request templates if available
#    - Reference related issues with `#issue-number`
#    - Use closing patterns like `Closes #123` to auto-close issues
# 5. **Assign reviewers and assignees**
# 6. **Create merge request**
# 
# #### Merge Request Features
# 
# GitLab Merge Requests include:
# 
# - **Inline code reviews**: Comment on specific lines
# - **Threaded discussions**: Track conversations
# - **Approval rules**: Require approvals before merging (Premium/Ultimate)
# - **CI/CD pipelines**: Automatic testing
# - **Auto-merge**: Merge automatically when conditions are met
# - **Draft status**: Mark MRs as work-in-progress
# 
# #### Working with Remotes in GitLab
# 
# ```bash
# # Clone your fork
# git clone https://gitlab.com/your-username/project.git
# cd project
# 
# # Add upstream remote
# git remote add upstream https://gitlab.com/original-owner/project.git
# 
# # Create a feature branch
# git checkout -b fix-bug
# 
# # Make changes and commit
# # ... edit files ...
# git add .
# git commit -m "Fix critical bug"
# 
# # Before pushing, sync with upstream
# git fetch upstream
# git rebase upstream/main
# 
# # Push to your fork
# git push origin fix-bug
# 
# # Create merge request on GitLab
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# ### GitLab Best Practices
# 
# 1. **Use descriptive MR titles**: Summarize the change clearly
# 2. **Link to issues**: Connect MRs to related issues for context
# 3. **Keep MRs focused**: One feature or fix per merge request
# 4. **Use draft MRs**: Mark work-in-progress with "Draft:" prefix
# 5. **Respond to feedback**: Address reviewer comments promptly
# 6. **Use CI/CD**: Ensure pipelines pass before merging
# 7. **Squash commits**: Keep history clean (when appropriate)
# 8. **Update documentation**: Include docs in your changes

# %% [markdown]
# ### Comparison: GitHub vs GitLab Workflows
# 
# | Feature | GitHub | GitLab |
# |---------|--------|--------|
# | Contribution model | Pull Request | Merge Request |
# | Fork update | Manual or sync fork button | Manual or update fork button |
# | Review process | Code review, comments | Code review, threaded discussions |
# | CI/CD | GitHub Actions | GitLab CI/CD (built-in) |
# | Project hosting | GitHub.com only | GitLab.com or self-hosted |
# | Issue tracking | GitHub Issues | GitLab Issues |
# | Draft/WIP | Draft Pull Request | Draft Merge Request |
# 
# Both platforms support similar workflows - the choice often depends on:
# - Your organization's preference
# - Self-hosting requirements
# - Specific features needed
# - Existing infrastructure

# ## Part 3: Introduction to Python
# 
# Python is a versatile, beginner-friendly programming language widely used in research. Now that 
# we've covered version control, it's time to start writing code! This section introduces Python 
# fundamentals that you'll build on in later lectures.
# 
# ### Why Python for Research?
# 
# - **Easy to learn**: Clear, readable syntax that resembles English
# - **Powerful libraries**: NumPy for numerical computing, pandas for data analysis, matplotlib for 
#   visualization, scikit-learn for machine learning, and thousands more
# - **Interactive**: Jupyter notebooks let you explore data and test ideas interactively
# - **Community**: Large, helpful community with extensive documentation and Stack Overflow answers
# - **Cross-platform**: Write once, run anywhere—Windows, macOS, or Linux
# - **Research-ready**: Used across all scientific domains from genomics to astronomy to economics
# 
# **Fun fact**: Python is named after Monty Python's Flying Circus, not the snake! The language was 
# designed to be fun to use, and you'll often see Monty Python references in Python documentation.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Python Basics: Variables and Data Types
# 
# Variables store data. Unlike some languages (like C++ or Java), Python is dynamically typed—
# you don't need to declare what type of data a variable holds. Python figures it out automatically 
# based on the value you assign. This makes Python code shorter and easier to read, though you need 
# to be careful about what types you're working with.

# %%
# Basic data types
project_name = "RNA Analysis"  # String
sample_count = 42              # Integer
temperature = 37.5             # Float
is_complete = True             # Boolean
nothing = None                 # None type

print(f"Project: {project_name}")
print(f"Samples: {sample_count}")
print(f"Temperature: {temperature}°C")
print(f"Complete: {is_complete}")
print(f"Placeholder: {nothing}")

# %%
# Type checking
print(f"Type of project_name: {type(project_name)}")
print(f"Type of sample_count: {type(sample_count)}")
print(f"Type of temperature: {type(temperature)}")
print(f"Type of is_complete: {type(is_complete)}")

# %% [markdown]
# **Understanding types**: Even though you don't declare types, Python still keeps track of them 
# internally. This matters when you try to combine values—you can't add a string to a number 
# directly. Use the `type()` function when debugging to check what type a variable actually is.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Working with Strings
# 
# Strings are sequences of characters—perfect for text data, DNA sequences, file paths, and more. 
# Python provides powerful string operations that you'll use constantly in research software.

# %%
# String operations
sequence = "ATCGATCG"
print(f"Sequence: {sequence}")
print(f"Length: {len(sequence)}")
print(f"First base: {sequence[0]}")
print(f"Last base: {sequence[-1]}")
print(f"First three: {sequence[0:3]}")
print(f"Reversed: {sequence[::-1]}")

# String methods
print(f"Lowercase: {sequence.lower()}")
print(f"Count of A: {sequence.count('A')}")
print(f"Replace A with N: {sequence.replace('A', 'N')}")

# %% [markdown]
# **String indexing**: Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning the first character is at position 
# 0, not 1. Negative indices count from the end: -1 is the last character, -2 is second-to-last, 
# etc. The slicing notation `[start:end]` gives you characters from `start` up to (but not including) 
# `end`. The special slice `[::-1]` reverses a string—useful for getting the reverse complement of 
# DNA sequences!

# %% [markdown]
# ### Lists: Ordered Collections
# 
# Lists store multiple values in order. They are mutable (can be changed after creation), making 
# them perfect for collecting measurements, storing sequences of results, or building up data as 
# your program runs. Lists are one of Python's most versatile and commonly-used data structures.

# %%
# Creating and using lists
measurements = [23.5, 24.1, 23.8, 24.3, 23.9]
print(f"Measurements: {measurements}")
print(f"First measurement: {measurements[0]}")
print(f"Last measurement: {measurements[-1]}")
print(f"Number of measurements: {len(measurements)}")

# Modifying lists
measurements.append(24.0)
print(f"After appending: {measurements}")

measurements[0] = 23.6
print(f"After modification: {measurements}")

# %% [markdown]
# **Lists are mutable**: Unlike strings, which can't be changed after creation (immutable), lists 
# can be modified. You can add items with `.append()`, remove items with `.remove()`, or change 
# individual elements by index. This mutability is powerful but requires care—if you pass a list 
# to a function and the function modifies it, the original list changes too!

# %%
# List operations
genes = ['BRCA1', 'TP53', 'EGFR']
print(f"Genes: {genes}")

# Adding elements
genes.append('MYC')
genes.insert(1, 'KRAS')
print(f"After adding: {genes}")

# Removing elements
genes.remove('TP53')
print(f"After removing TP53: {genes}")

last_gene = genes.pop()
print(f"Popped: {last_gene}, Remaining: {genes}")

# %%
# List slicing
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
print(f"Original: {data}")
print(f"First three: {data[0:3]}")
print(f"Middle elements: {data[3:7]}")
print(f"Every other element: {data[::2]}")
print(f"Reversed: {data[::-1]}")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Dictionaries: Key-Value Pairs
# 
# Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs. Keys must be unique.

# %%
# Creating dictionaries
experiment = {
    'name': 'Temperature Study',
    'duration_days': 30,
    'sample_size': 150,
    'temperature': 25.0,
    'completed': True
}

print("Experiment details:")
for key, value in experiment.items():
    print(f"  {key}: {value}")

# %%
# Accessing dictionary values
print(f"\nExperiment name: {experiment['name']}")
print(f"Duration: {experiment['duration_days']} days")

# Adding new keys
experiment['location'] = 'Lab A'
experiment['researcher'] = 'Dr. Smith'

# Modifying values
experiment['completed'] = False

print(f"\nUpdated experiment: {experiment}")

# %%
# Dictionary methods
print(f"Keys: {list(experiment.keys())}")
print(f"Values: {list(experiment.values())}")

# Safe access with get()
funding = experiment.get('funding', 'Not specified')
print(f"Funding: {funding}")

# Check if key exists
if 'location' in experiment:
    print(f"Location found: {experiment['location']}")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Control Flow: Making Decisions
# 
# Control structures let programs make decisions and repeat actions.

# %%
# If statements
temperature = 26.5
threshold = 25.0

if temperature > threshold:
    print(f"{temperature}°C is above threshold")
elif temperature < threshold:
    print(f"{temperature}°C is below threshold")
else:
    print(f"{temperature}°C equals threshold")

# %%
# Combining conditions
temp = 24.5
humidity = 65

if temp >= 20 and temp <= 30:
    print("Temperature in optimal range")
    
if humidity < 70 or temp < 22:
    print("At least one parameter is outside ideal range")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Loops: Repeating Actions
# 
# #### For Loops
# 
# Iterate over sequences (lists, strings, ranges).

# %%
# For loop with list
samples = ['S1', 'S2', 'S3', 'S4']

print("Processing samples:")
for sample in samples:
    print(f"  Analyzing {sample}")

# %%
# For loop with range
print("\nCounting:")
for i in range(5):
    print(f"  Count: {i}")

print("\nCounting from 10 to 15:")
for i in range(10, 16):
    print(f"  Count: {i}")

# %%
# Enumerate for index and value
data_files = ['exp1.csv', 'exp2.csv', 'exp3.csv']

for index, filename in enumerate(data_files):

# #### While Loops
# 
# Repeat while a condition is true.

# %%
# While loop example
count = 0

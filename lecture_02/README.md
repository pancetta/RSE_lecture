# Lecture 2: Advanced Git, GitHub, and Python Basics

## Overview
This lecture builds on Git fundamentals from Lecture 1, introduces collaboration with GitHub,
and begins our journey into Python programming. We'll learn advanced version control workflows
and start writing our first Python code.

**Duration**: ~90 minutes

## Topics Covered
- Advanced Git: branching, merging, and conflict resolution
- .gitignore patterns and file management
- GitHub collaboration: forking, pull requests, and remotes
- Python fundamentals (variables, data types, strings)
- Python collections (lists, dictionaries)
- Control flow (if statements, for loops, while loops)
- Basic functions and documentation
- Practical examples combining Git and Python

Welcome to the Research Software Engineering (RSE) lecture series! This repository contains materials for learning best practices in developing high-quality research software.

## Course Overview

This lecture series covers 14 lectures (~90 minutes each) on Research Software Engineering fundamentals:

- **Lecture 1**: Introduction to RSE, Shell Basics, and Git Fundamentals
- **Lecture 2**: Advanced Git, GitHub & GitLab Collaboration, and Python Basics
- **Lecture 3**: Python Fundamentals and Advanced Concepts
- **Lecture 4**: Python Project Structure and Scientific Libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- **Lecture 5**: Testing Research Software
- **Lecture 6**: Automation and Continuous Integration
- **Lecture 7**: Debugging and Profiling Research Software
- **Lecture 8**: Documenting and Publishing Research Software
- **Lecture 9**: Containerization and Reproducibility
- **Lecture 10**: Collaboration and Code Review in Research Software
- **Lecture 11**: Working with Research Data - File Formats and Databases
- **Lecture 12**: Scientific Workflows and Automation
- **Lecture 13**: AI-Assisted Coding for Research Software
- **Lecture 14**: Course Summary and the RSE Community

**Integrated Topics:** Throughout the course, we cover software architecture and design principles including DRY, Single Responsibility, code smells, refactoring strategies, and architectural code review.

## Getting Started

### Quick Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pancetta/RSE_course_JuRSE.git
   cd RSE_course_JuRSE
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   
   Install [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html), then create the environment:
   
   ```bash
   # For development (includes all dependencies)
   make install-dev
   micromamba activate rse_lecture
   ```
   
   Or for a specific lecture:
   ```bash
   make install-lecture4  # Example for lecture 4
   micromamba activate rse_lecture
   ```

3. **View the lectures:**
   
   ```bash
   # Start the interactive website
   make serve-website
   ```
   
   Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`

### Working with Notebooks

Convert lecture files to Jupyter notebooks:
```bash
make convert
jupyter notebook
```
